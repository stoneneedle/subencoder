不能再接收更多孩子了
It doesn't need any more kids.

144
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,080
因此 孩子必得D移 而且生活l件更差
So for a child to be removed, conditions have to be pretty bleak,

145
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,380

Very sweet, a little guarded. Kind of had a little wall around her.

375
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,340
τ谕g人碚f她也很矮小  有可能是烟r酒或者
Really small for her age too. Maybe a fetal alcohol thing or

376

Of course. You should be really proud. I am.

390
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,650
我受不了看著那些了  不管了  我要去那了
I'm sick of looking at that. To hell with it. I'm going over there.

Everybody's avoiding them like they're dipped in shit. I'm just gonna

I know. I think it's awful. But they're teenagers, okay?

397
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,300
他吸毒  他打wC
They use drugs, and they masturbate,

398
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,370
他在油管W站上看e人玩子游
and they watch people playing video games on YouTube.

399
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,570
我]槟切┳龊  那我槭裁醋龊
We're not equipped for that. What do we have to be equipped for?

400
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,810
我只是想去打招呼  我知道  我不J槲那么做
I'm just going to say hello. I know. I don't think we should do that.

401

403
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,880
只是想告V你一下  我都能的
Just FYI, we can all hear you.

404
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,110
什么  粘^屎
Hmm? "Dipped in shit."

405
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,580
打wC  @些
"Masturbate," so forth.

406
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,770
我很感x@些P心  但]必要f的@么
Uh, we appreciate the concern, but there's no need to go all pity

407
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,150

crazy.

408
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,520
我知道@是怎么淼
We know how this works.

409
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
去e的地方吧  ]事的
So just go on. It's okay.

410
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,690
去和那些小孩子混在一起  不要多想  好
Go mingle with the kiddies and don't give it another thought, okay?

411
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,760
^得愉快  xx  再
Have a good day, folks. Thanks. Bye-bye.

412
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,610
那么  你出去  是o自己找了青少年
So, you two went out and found yourself a teenager after all, huh?

413
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,580
我只了酌腌  但是她留下了一很好的印象
We only met her for a second. But she made a real impression.

414
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,650
是的  是一很好的孩子
Oh, yeah. Lizzy's such a great kid.

415
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,020
她在W校表F很好  磉@
She does really well in school. Come on back.

416
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,890
四年前她十一q的r候就碚疹所了
She came into care four years ago when she was 11.

417
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,660
花了很久去裾f她接受安置在一寄B家庭
Took a lot to convince her to accept placement in an adoptive home.

418
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,830
她  把房子弄起火了  在裂掉的管子旁倒了
Her mother... Set the house on fire, passed out with a crack pipe.

419
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,430
我想f的是  在我f出事之前
What I was gonna say... Before I told it like it is?

420
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,300
在你打辔抑前
Before you jumped on in there,

421
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,840
她@啄碓S下了很多承Z
is that her mother's made a lot of promises over the years

422
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,770
但]有⑺M行到底
and never seems to follow through with them.

423
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,340
她F在在哪里
Where's her mom now?

424
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,710
也S在院子里穿著B衣u著香
Probably in an orange jumpsuit selling smokes in the yard.

425
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,880
我保C那并不蚀_
I'm sure that's not accurate.

426
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,780
最后lF的就在Oz里接受判Q
Huh. Turns out Lizzy's mom is finishing a sentence in county jail.

427
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,820
lf^什么  lf^
Who called it, huh? Who said it?

428
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,220
你f^  好吧
You did. Yeah.

429
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,050
看起硭]有砗退的孩子重聚
Looks like she's never pursued reunification

430
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,990
也在超^赡]有系^她的孩子
or contacted her kids in over two years,

431
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,160
那么  好吧  她差不多就是o足p重的事
so, yeah, she's pretty much a nonissue.

432
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,160
@糟糕O了  那她爸爸呢
That's terrible. What about the father?

433
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,770
你在f什么呢  爸爸
What are you talking about, "father"?

434
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,400
你在o我表演喜  彼得
What, are you doing comedy for us now, Pete?

435
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,970
P  我有很多站出淼陌职
Karen, we've had plenty of fathers who have stepped up,

436
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,480
但是在@里  任何生父都]有名字
but in this case, no ID's on any birth fathers.

437
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,840
著  的是w系下的a物
Look, Lizzy's mom is a product of the system

438
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,730
她]W^怎么照好自己  更不要f三
and she never learned to properly care for herself, much less three

439
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,010
孩子了
kids.

440
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,480
三  三孩子  什么
Three? Three kids? Oh. What?

441
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,510
是的  三
Yeah, three.

442
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,350
是的    一次生下的
Yeah, Lizzy... At once?

443
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,690
是的  和她小c的同胞兄妹阮和塔是一起淼
Yeah, Lizzy comes with two younger siblings, Juan and Lita.

444
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,360
等等  那我  要I三孩子
Wait, wait. So we would have... three children?

445
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,960
不  吧  也S  但是我不可能能IB三的
No. Two, maybe, but there's no way we can do three.

446
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,160
我的意思是  我曾想去看看  天啊
I mean, we wanted to meet... Oh, my gosh.

447
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,400
槭裁醋我看@  你是混蛋
Why would you show us that? You're an asshole.

448
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,970
你槭裁匆我看@  他@么可  @么做不
Why would you even show that? They're so cute. That's wrong.

449
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,070
J真  我不掩@件事  好
Listen, we're not gonna sugarcoat it, okay?

450
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,040
塔是  野U吵[的孩子
Lita is a... a wild, rowdy kid,

451
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,140
阮有c脆弱  感情上有c敏感
and Juan can be fragile and a little emotional,

452
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,210
意志力很  她不p易信任他人
and Lizzy is strong-willed and she won't trust easily.

453
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,450
@你能怪她  好吧  但是著
God, can you blame her? Well, but listen.

454
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,480
我一般不建h@次配  要不是我相信
We wouldn't recommend this match if we didn't believe

455
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,750
通^一些造和感情
that with some structure and love

456
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,590
@三孩子也S`放出花  明白

457
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,290
是的  并且我希望能蜃他[F在的寄B
Yeah, and we're hoping to get them out of their current foster

458
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:21,720

459
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,690
R斯基一家也S失去@票  P  ef了
The Muskies might lose that meal ticket. Karen, please.

460
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,530
我大多档募酿B父母是很棒的很有同情心的人
Most of our foster parents are really terrific, caring people.

461
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,930
但_也有些人是榱顺诙做@些
And, yes, there are people who do it just for the paycheck.

462
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,070
但R斯基一家并不是虐待或者有害的
But the Muskies are not abusive or evil.

463
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,000
只是有一c  近HY婚
Just maybe a little... Inbred.

464
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,810
P  ]有C表明  你^他了
Karen, there is no evidence to... You've seen 'em.

465
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,510
我l誓他看起硐裥置  我分辨不出他
I swear they look like brother and sister. I can't tell them apart.

466
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,650
不管怎么f  我很芬獍才乓探L
In any case, I'd love to set up a visitation,

467
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,680
除非你有e的]
unless you have any other concerns.

468
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,050
只是一探L  那么
It's just a visitation. So...

你知道{色的家伙是怎么]k法敉四切聿傻V的人
You know how the blue guys couldn't fight off the unobtanium guys

473
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,560
直到白色的人出F了并窝b成了一{色的人
until the white guy showed up and pretended to be a blue guy?

474
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,930
我想f的是  白w色的夫D接{著拉丁小孩
All I'm saying is, white-bread couple taking in little Latin kids.

475
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,830
人不X得我不@么做
Are people gonna think we shouldn't be doing that?

476
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,340
你知道  我重新把那些小孩放回去
You know what? We'll go ahead and toss these kids back into the system

477
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,500
然后o你下  HIB白w色小孩

Don't write "whites only." That's not what he meant. That's not

480
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,040
焊不是我的意思
at all what I meant.

481
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,580
彼得  我感激你的文化敏感
Pete, I appreciate your cultural sensitivity,

482
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,950
但是我@里收{了各Nw色的小孩
