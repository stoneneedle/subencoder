5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,220
You bought this? Yeah.

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,020
And it's ours now. We own this. Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,390
I love it. Right?

8
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,630
What'd I tell you? The fireplace, the built-ins here.

9
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,700
Are you sure you want to give this to your sister?

10
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,830
Babe, we'd make 100K off this flip all day long.

11
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,800
Trying to make up... This is it?

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,970
Hey, yeah. Come in. You guys made me ask off an hour early to see

13
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,570
this dump?

14
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,780
We're all smelling this, right? Yeah, it smells like I'm

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,570
breathing piss.

16
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,280
Okay. Not a good fit. So we'll just go.

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,340
Come on. Come on. Have a little vision.

18
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,680
French doors to the garden.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,250
We move the stairs, take these walls down,

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,480
create an open concept through the kitchen.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,430
There's a gorgeous stained glass here in the corner. The bones are

22
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:23,950
really good.

23
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,560
When's the part we cough up 12 grand to fix the rotted-out foundation?

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,430
Clearly, it's not for them. Let's just flip this one, El.

25
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,990
There's a park across the street.

26
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,730
And the schools here are fantastic if you have a baby.

27
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,760
When. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kimmy.

28
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,400
When. When you have a baby.

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,070
We're having a baby. We are having a baby.

30
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,570
You see that? That's called manifesting to the universe.

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,310
Sometimes the universe thinks it's funny if I drop $26,000 on in

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,010
vitro first.

33
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,140
Oh! You're a dick. I'm kidding.

34
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,810
If this place is so great, why don't you guys move in here?

35
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,210
What are they gonna do with five bedrooms and a park?

36
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,220
They're obviously never having kids.

37
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,850
Look at 'em. They don't have any emotional holes to fill.

38
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,750
Not that we are doing it to fill...

39
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,490
Shut up, Russ. All right.

40
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,490
What was that look? What look?

41
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,110
He just said you guys were never gonna have kids. Then you did a

42
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,890
definite look.

43
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,180
Yeah, what was the look for? You looked back at me to include me in

44
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,660
your look.

45
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,360
I didn't do a look. Totally did a look.

46
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,000
It wasn't a look. I think we just started some trouble.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,870
There's no trouble. Maybe even a fight.

48
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,340
There's no fight. There's no trouble. Let's get out of here.

49
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,270
Oh, my God. You guys are gonna have kids now, aren't you?

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,440
No. What? Kimmy. I don't know. What?

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,510
Of course you are, because you have to win at everything.

52
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,680
Then you're gonna throw your perfect uterus in my face too.

53
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,350
How do you know my uterus is perfect? We've never even tried to have

54
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,550
kids.

55
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,120
I don't know if I can get pregnant.

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,180
Of course it is perfect. It is yours.

57
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,120
Kimmy. It probably has a leather interior.

58
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,590
Please, Kimmy. You just got here.

59
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,460
Sorry, Petey. Have a good fight.

60
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,760
See you later, Russ.

61
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,760
I didn't do a look. You're doing a look right now.

62
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,170
There's no look. You're doing a look.

63
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,410
All right, maybe I did do a look.

64
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,840
But just hearing him say it out loud: "We're never having children."

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,010
I mean, is that true?

66
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,040
I quit bringing it up because every time I did, you'd say it's not

67
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,710
the right time.

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,750
I know, but we were always so broke.

69
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,750
And then we were going crazy trying to get the business started.

70
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,320
We've flipped five houses this year, and I'm starting to turn down

71
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,960
design work.

72
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,160
I always thought that I'd be a mom someday.

73
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,390
I think I'm ready. Great. Now you're ready.

74
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,030
And by the time the kid's 16, I'm gonna be one of those old dads,

75
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,870
like Brian Hendrickson's dad.

76
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Hey, Dad. What's up, Son?

77
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,710
Hey, Mr. Hendrickson, go long!

78
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,510
Dad?

79
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,950
You killed my dad!

80
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,520
Hey. Hey, Dad. Wake up, wake up. Wake up!

81
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,850
You did not kill Mr. Hendrickson.

82
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,590
And you're not that old.

83
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,690
Here's an idea. What if we adopt a five-year-old?

84
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,790
It'd be like I got cracking when I was 36. How about that?

85
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,770
Keep your end straight, will you?

86
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,870
Look, you're overthinking it, bro. None of my kids were planned.

87
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,970
Kid shows up, you figure it out. Easy-peasy.

88
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,060
How many kids you got now, Stu? Number four's in the oven right

89
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,240
Now.

90
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,410
Wow. Nothing hard about kids.

91
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,580
As long as you spend some time with them, they're cool.

92
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,720
Most important thing, make sure the moms all get along.

93
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,560
Meatball. Hey! Hey, buddy!

94
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,260
Hey. You miss me?

95
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,890
Oh! That's my boy. You missed me, huh? I missed you too.

96
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,690
Yeah. You're such a good boy.

97
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,100
Hey, El. I got the towel samples you wanted for the kitchen.

98
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,000
El, you okay?

99
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,940
Hey, what's the matter?

100
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,570
Nothing. I was just thinking about what you said about adopting a

101
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,340
Five-year-old.

102
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,780
I said that? Yeah.

103
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,010
I was totally... I was joking. I know. It's kind of crazy.

104
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,110
But it just got me thinking. And there's so many kids in foster care.

105
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,580
And they're moving from place to place, and they don't have anybody,

106
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,720
and it's like the saddest thing I've ever seen.

107
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,760
I found this adoption agency. They're having an orientation next week.

108
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,690
No, don't show me that. I don't want to see those little faces.

109
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,230
You trying to break my heart? I just got home from work.

110
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,000
Ellie, people who take in foster kids are really special.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,550
These are the kind of people who volunteer when it's not even a

112
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:23,860
Holiday.

113
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,130
We don't even volunteer on a holiday.

114
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,670
What if there was, like, a disaster?

115
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,240
What, like a dirty bomb? Whatever.

116
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,870
And there's a little kid who ends up on our doorstep.

117
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
Are we gonna turn her away because we're not special enough?

118
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,250
That would depend. There's a lot of factors that go into it.

119
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,480
I mean, our food rations, the blast radius.

120
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,350
El, you can't take some offhanded remark I made

121
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,520
and turn it into a crazy life decision.

122
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,960
It was a joke.

123
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,120
Yeah.

124
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,260
I know. I just...

125
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,200
You're right. You shouldn't be pushed into something you don't want

126
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,460
to do.

127
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,700
It was just a nice thought.

128
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,440
Good night.

129
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,170
All right, I won't make any more jokes like that.

130
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,040
All right?

131
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,780
You wanna watch a little Fixer Upper?

132
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,320
Okay, I love you. I love you.

133
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,420
That's a long fill-up, my friend.

134
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,550
Well, that's because I wanted you to come in here.

135
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,160
We're gonna have a karate kicking contest. Me versus you, straight up.

136
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,080
Oh, God.

137
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,990
It's not fair. That is not...

138
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,590
Hey.

139
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,230
You can't buy these pita chips anymore. They're way too spicy.

140
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm getting my nose watery and...

141
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,200
Over a half million children are currently in foster care.

142
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,070
The system is overloaded, okay?

143
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,840
It doesn't need any more kids.

144
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,080
So for a child to be removed, conditions have to be pretty bleak,

145
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,380
usually involving abuse or extreme neglect.

146
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,520
And some of these kids can often languish in the system,

147
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,350
unless a wonderful family like yours steps up for them.

148
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,760
We'll step up. We'll take one right away.

149
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,390
Perfect. Let me go check in back, see what we have in stock.

150
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,860
She is kidding, of course.

151
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,600
We do not stock.

152
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,500
And you know that.

153
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,200
But we can take you through the eight-week foster parenting course,

154
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,840
and you can get your certification.

155
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,870
And then we can pair you with some kids that you can foster

156
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,470
until they become adoptable.

157
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,880
But it is not gonna be easy, folks.

158
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,880
These kids will test your will,

159
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,410
put a strain on your relationship,

160
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,780
and push buttons you didn't even know you had.

161
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,690
I can tell by looking at you that not all y'all are gonna make it.

162
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,820
I actually think this group has got the grit to face some unpleasant..

163
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,830
Excuse me. Y-You guys heading out?

164
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,530
Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you. Bye-bye.

165
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,430
All right, that one's on me. It absolutely is.

166
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,330
We've gone over this before. We have.

167
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,130
This is a problem. It's a problem.

168
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,440
Okay, everybody, why don't we learn your names

169
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,770
and what type of children you're looking for.

170
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,310
Oh, hi.

171
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,180
We're Dana and Dirk McCann.

172
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,110
And the Lord has guided us here

173
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,310
to adopt a baby boy... or a girl.

174
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,150
Yeah, the big guy, he's blessed us with so much. Mm-hmm.

175
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,180
We'd just like to share it with a child that needs a home. Yeah.

176
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,390
What about over here?

177
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,990
I'm David, and this is my wife, Jessie.

178
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,190
And we've been trying to have a baby for three years now.

179
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,670
But no matter what we do, I... I can't...

180
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,330
I'm sorry. Can someone else go? It's okay.

181
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,000
It's okay. Well, I'm Kit and this is Michael.

182
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,170
We've also been trying to conceive now.

183
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,410
Pretty much since the first night we met, right?

184
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,080
That is correct. We're just not having any luck.

185
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,180
We're looking for a child of any gender 

186
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,420
or ethnicity up to nine years old.

187
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,280
Hello. My name is October Ross Jennings.

188
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,110
And I would like to be the single mother

189
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,690
 of an athletically gifted teen boy

190
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,060
who I can help to reach his full Division One scholarship potential.

191
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,530
Preferably African-American.

192
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,830
Mm-hmm. Right?

193
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,060
Like The Blind Side. Like the movie. Right? That's great.

194
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,370
Honey, she's not joking.

195
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,670
A-Are you jo... You're not joking? My God. I'm so sorry.

196
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,680
I just thought 'cause of the gay guys' conceiving joke that we were...

197
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,110
I mean, that is the plot of The Blind Side, so...

198
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,300
I've never seen it. So, please, it's your turn. Just do not talk to

199
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,980
me anymore.

200
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,520
Yeah, she's nuts.

201
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,950
I'm so sorry. I feel terrible. I, uh...

202
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,390
So, my name's Ellie. Hi. This is my husband, Pete.

203
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,330
Uh, yeah, I mean, I'm not too sure about any of this.

204
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,240
I mean, I get it. We adopted our dog Meatball, and we love him like

205
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,800
crazy, but...

206
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,030
Don't compare kids to dogs. I'm not.

207
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,610
I'm just saying there used to be a stigma about getting a dog from

208
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,000
the pound,

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,030
but now they're called rescue dogs and everybody wants one.

210
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,900
Don't say "pound," don't say "dog." Just don't.

211
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,470
Okay, no, that's not...

212
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,540
It's just all of this is a little scary, right?

213
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,850
But maybe if you call them rescue kids... Oh, my God.

214
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,010
...instead of foster kids, more people would be into it

215
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,450
and people wouldn't walk out in the middle of your seminar

216
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,280
and it'd be good for your program. Pete! Pete!

217
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,690
I'm just saying... Just stop it!

218
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,120
Oh, everyone, our guest speaker of the day,

219
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,150
Brenda Fernandez and her parents.

220
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,560
Let's make them feel welcome.

221
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Hey, thank you.

222
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,530
Hi.

223
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,300
So, when I was eight years old,

224
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,170
my mom and her boyfriend decided it would be a good idea

225
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,770
to build a meth lab in our garage.

226
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,070
They made me deliver drugs for them.

227
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,820
They abused me physically, and some of their customers abused me

228
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,340
sexually.

229
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,550
Uh, when I was 11, our garage exploded,

230
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,580
and I was put in the system,

231
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,020
bounced around from placement to placement.

232
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,020
Pretty soon I was 14.

233
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,530
Nobody wants a teenager, so I'd be aging out in a few years.

234
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,830
The thing is, over half the kids who age out of foster care

235
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,530
end up homeless, addicted, incarcerated, or dead within two years.

236
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,130
That was gonna be me, trying to start my adult life,

237
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,900
but with no family to help me pick a college,

238
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,010
nobody to come home to on the holidays

239
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,850
or cry to when my first boyfriend dumped me for Missy Howard.

240
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,620
But then those two... very special people came along.

241
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,120
And I didn't make it easy on them.

242
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,920
But no matter how hard I pushed them away,

243
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,660
they were always there with a sack lunch and a ride.

244
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,460
Thanks, you guys.

245
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,070
Come here, Daddy. You too, Mama.

246
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,640
That was good.

247
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,990
I am so sorry about the Blind Side comment.

248
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,520
I love the movie.

249
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,790
Bye, Brenda. Great job. Amazing. All right, Kit, bye.

250
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,930
Dirk. We'll see you in the classes, buddy. Bye, guys. Hey.

251
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,830
So now you think we're special enough? Maybe we are.

252
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,500
I mean, this is what we do.

253
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,330
We see potential in things, we fix 'em up. Like they did.

254
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,370
They find this kid in a state of disrepair,

255
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,700
they give her a new coat of paint, scrape off her emotional popcorn

256
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:36,970
ceiling,

257
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,370
install some countertops in the form of love or self-esteem, whatever.

258
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,280
I'm not saying she's a house like the way I said the dog thing in

259
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,540
there,

260
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,510
but I think we're perfect for this.

261
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,880
But she's really... she's not a house, Pete.

262
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,560
I just said she's not a house. Are you listening to me? Okay. No,

263
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:50,750
I am.

264
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,350
I'm so exci... Are you excited?

265
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,150
I just get worried

266
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,220
that you think things are gonna be easier than they actually are.

267
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,220
What? I do not. You do.

268
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,780
This whole thing was your idea. Now I'm pumped about it, and you're

269
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:03,930
not?

270
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,060
No, no, I am pumped. Well, you don't look pumped.

271
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,130
A big, life-altering moment like this, you gotta get pumped.

272
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,500
We're about to do something insane.

273
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,070
Did you hear her speak? Yes.

274
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,840
It was the greatest thing I've ever heard. I know.

275
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,970
Come on, cowgirl, let me get a "yee-haw." Yee-haw.

276
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,140
No, bull. Gimme one. Yee-haw!

277
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,980
Louder. Crazier. Come on. Come on! You're about to be a mom!

278
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,680
Yaaa-hoo!

279
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,120
Add a balloon, El.

280
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,720
Okay, have a seat.

281
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,820
Time's up.

282
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,190
These are your fantasy kids.

283
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,890
They are not your real children.

284
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,260
Come on, Jessie. You're losing her.

285
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,300
Pete. Pete, Pete! Ticktock, muscle man.

286
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,020
That's not gonna bring him back from that peanut butter sandwich you

287
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,330
fed him.

288
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,640
Your real kids will be very different. Can't erase 'em.

289
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,080
Good job, Michael.

290
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,310
All right, October.

291
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,180
I'm calling it. Yours is dead.

292
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,220
All there?

293
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,990
Time to erase these ideals right now.

294
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,060
Almost done.

295
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,960
Almost done. Okay. Okay.

296
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,960
Thank you. Thank you.

297
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,310
All right, everybody, I want you all to imagine

299
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,780
you got this plush new job.

300
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,910
They give you a nice big office.

301
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,210
There's a gym and a frozen yogurt machine right there in the break

302
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:44,450
room.

303
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,880
I love frozen yogurt.

304
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,790
But deep down, you know you're not qualified.

305
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,130
In your heart of hearts,

306
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,100
you know you're not good enough and you are going to get fired.

307
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,070
The same way you got fired from your last three jobs.

308
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,500
And you might quit just to get some control back.

309
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,510
Hell, you might even tip over that damn yogurt machine

310
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,780
and walk your ass right on out of there.

311
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,040
Just to clarify,

312
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,080
Karen is not advocating vandalism in the workplace.

313
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,880
The point is, that it's the same...

314
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,050
for a displaced child...

315
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,160
who knows... that you don't want her.

316
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,630
Except instead of grieving...

317
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,190
the loss of a job,

318
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,770
she's losing her connection

319
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,800
with everything and everyone.

320
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,240
But the one connection

321
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,140
that can remain

322
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,070
is between siblings.

323
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,180
Sometimes it's easier for sibs to adjust

324
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,880
because they're not going through it all alone.

325
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,550
You might want to consider upgrading to a sibling set.

326
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,450
Dirk? Would you consider siblings?

327
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,250
The big guy might smile on that.

328
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,360
Um, w-we'd have to...

329
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,290
We'd pray on that. Right, honey. Yeah.

330
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,530
Pray on it. The big guy wouldn't give you any more than you can

331
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:13,860
handle.

332
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,170
I beg to differ.

333
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,240
Pete. Ellie. Hey.

334
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,550
You made it. Hi.

335
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,080
Just sign in, and take this form with you

336
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,800
and write down the name of any kid you meet you might be interested

337
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:38,920
in.

338
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Really? That's how this works?

339
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,790
Yeah, it can feel a little like shopping for kids.

340
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,960
It's messed up, I know, but the county puts these on

341
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,890
because they can match a lot of kids and parents quickly.

342
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,260
God, look at the big kids over there.

343
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,830
Breaks my heart.

344
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,370
Most folks want nothing to do with teenagers.

345
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,890
Of course, if you two thought you could make room for an older child..

346
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,040
Um, I mean... I... Oh, God.

347
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,310
I'm so sor... We... We're terrible people. I'm sorry.

348
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:10,450
You're not terrible. Now get on in there and find you a family. Go on.

349
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,520
God, it's so weird.

350
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,060
Normally, you go out and chat up some random kid in a park and you're

351
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,750
gonna get arrested.

352
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,520
Now we're just supposed to? I know.

353
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,990
This little guy's all by himself. You want to go say hi?

354
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,660
Yeah. Okay.

355
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,130
Excuse me. Sorry. So sorry. Occupied. Hey! Sorry.

356
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,000
Occupied! Sorry!

357
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,300
We just went to get treats. So, yeah, just back it up. Okay?

358
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,670
Hey, look, we got some snacks. Come on, Lucas, right over here.

359
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,910
Hey. Excuse me! Heads up!

360
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,710
Never mind. Thanks.

361
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,880
You just take it and try to throw it into his mouth.

362
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,680
Really. You want to have a go?

363
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,620
Oh.

364
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,090
Nice to meet you.

365
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,690
Get it? Oh, yeah. Bring her in!

366
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,390
Hey. You gotta wait for your turn, buddy.

367
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,660
I'm sorry. Let's... Let's just go. Let's just go.

368
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,530
Pete. Ellie.

369
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,000
How's it going? Hey.

370
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,270
Yeah, well... it's a little weird.

371
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,410
Yeah, these things can be kind of awkward.

372
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,110
But did you meet any kids that you're curious about?

373
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,580
We met one little girl who was sitting all by herself.

374
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,620
Very sweet, a little guarded. Kind of had a little wall around her.

375
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,340
Really small for her age too. Maybe a fetal alcohol thing or

376
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,950
something.

377
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,550
I saw her... Oh, right there.

378
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,320
The little sad-looking one with pigtails

379
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,560
who seems like she's been chained to a radiator half her life.

380
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,130
Uh, that's my daughter. The radiator kid?

381
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,760
What?

382
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,060
Yeah. That's my daughter.

383
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,630
I'm so sorry.

384
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,670
You don't have to be sorry. I'm really proud of her.

385
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,200
The reason she's sitting away from others is because she has a family,

386
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,140
a very happy family.

387
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,520
And I didn't drink a drop when I was pregnant. Nor do I have a

388
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,010
radiator.

389
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,910
Of course. You should be really proud. I am.

390
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,650
I'm sick of looking at that. To hell with it. I'm going over there.

391
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,260
Pete. Hey, Pete.

392
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,820
Pete, what are you doing? Look at them over there.

393
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,210
Everybody's avoiding them like they're dipped in shit. I'm just gonna

394
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:19,700
go say hi.

395
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,400
Yeah, okay... Hey, Pete, Pete, just wait.

396
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,430
I know. I think it's awful. But they're teenagers, okay?

397
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,300
They use drugs, and they masturbate,

398
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,370
and they watch people playing video games on YouTube.

399
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,570
We're not equipped for that. What do we have to be equipped for?

400
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,810
I'm just going to say hello. I know. I don't think we should do that.

401
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,410
Excuse me? Hi. Hey. Hi.

402
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,710
Hi!

403
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,880
Just FYI, we can all hear you.

404
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,110
Hmm? "Dipped in shit."

405
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,580
"Masturbate," so forth.

406
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,770
Uh, we appreciate the concern, but there's no need to go all pity

407
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,150
crazy.

408
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,520
We know how this works.

409
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
So just go on. It's okay.

410
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,690
Go mingle with the kiddies and don't give it another thought, okay?

411
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,760
Have a good day, folks. Thanks. Bye-bye.

412
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,610
So, you two went out and found yourself a teenager after all, huh?

413
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,580
We only met her for a second. But she made a real impression.

414
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,650
Oh, yeah. Lizzy's such a great kid.

415
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,020
She does really well in school. Come on back.

416
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,890
She came into care four years ago when she was 11.

417
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,660
Took a lot to convince her to accept placement in an adoptive home.

418
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,830
Her mother... Set the house on fire, passed out with a crack pipe.

419
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,430
What I was gonna say... Before I told it like it is?

420
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,300
Before you jumped on in there,

421
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,840
is that her mother's made a lot of promises over the years

422
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,770
and never seems to follow through with them.

423
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,340
Where's her mom now?

424
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,710
Probably in an orange jumpsuit selling smokes in the yard.

425
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,880
I'm sure that's not accurate.

426
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,780
Huh. Turns out Lizzy's mom is finishing a sentence in county jail.

427
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,820
Who called it, huh? Who said it?

428
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,220
You did. Yeah.

429
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,050
Looks like she's never pursued reunification

430
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,990
or contacted her kids in over two years,

431
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,160
so, yeah, she's pretty much a nonissue.

432
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,160
That's terrible. What about the father?

433
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,770
What are you talking about, "father"?

434
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,400
What, are you doing comedy for us now, Pete?

435
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,970
Karen, we've had plenty of fathers who have stepped up,

436
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,480
but in this case, no ID's on any birth fathers.

437
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,840
Look, Lizzy's mom is a product of the system

438
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,730
and she never learned to properly care for herself, much less three

439
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,010
kids.

440
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,480
Three? Three kids? Oh. What?

441
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,510
Yeah, three.

442
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,350
Yeah, Lizzy... At once?

443
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,690
Yeah, Lizzy comes with two younger siblings, Juan and Lita.

444
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,360
Wait, wait. So we would have... three children?

445
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,960
No. Two, maybe, but there's no way we can do three.

446
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,160
I mean, we wanted to meet... Oh, my gosh.

447
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,400
Why would you show us that? You're an asshole.

448
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,970
Why would you even show that? They're so cute. That's wrong.

449
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,070
Listen, we're not gonna sugarcoat it, okay?

450
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,040
Lita is a... a wild, rowdy kid,

451
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,140
and Juan can be fragile and a little emotional,

452
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,210
and Lizzy is strong-willed and she won't trust easily.

453
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,450
God, can you blame her? Well, but listen.

454
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,480
We wouldn't recommend this match if we didn't believe

455
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,750
that with some structure and love

456
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,590
these... these kids could blossom, right?

457
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,290
Yeah, and we're hoping to get them out of their current foster

458
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:21,720
placement.

459
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,690
The Muskies might lose that meal ticket. Karen, please.

460
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,530
Most of our foster parents are really terrific, caring people.

461
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,930
And, yes, there are people who do it just for the paycheck.

462
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,070
But the Muskies are not abusive or evil.

463
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,000
Just maybe a little... Inbred.

464
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,810
Karen, there is no evidence to... You've seen 'em.

465
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,510
I swear they look like brother and sister. I can't tell them apart.

466
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,650
In any case, I'd love to set up a visitation,

467
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,680
unless you have any other concerns.

468
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,050
It's just a visitation. So...

469
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,050
I-I-It's just... Is it a problem...

470
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,820
You know, the whole white savior thing?

471
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,690
Like the Avatar thing. Avatar?

472
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,090
You know how the blue guys couldn't fight off the unobtanium guys

473
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,560
until the white guy showed up and pretended to be a blue guy?

474
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,930
All I'm saying is, white-bread couple taking in little Latin kids.

475
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,830
Are people gonna think we shouldn't be doing that?

476
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,340
You know what? We'll go ahead and toss these kids back into the system

477
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,500
and I'll just jot you down for "whites only."

478
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,340
Come on. I didn't mean... Hey! No, that's not...

479
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,200
Don't write "whites only." That's not what he meant. That's not

480
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,040
at all what I meant.

481
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,580
Pete, I appreciate your cultural sensitivity,

482
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,950
but we have every color of kid in the system.

483
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,590
And we have every color of parent. Every color.

484
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,660
Just not nearly enough. Not nearly enough parents.

485
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,020
And listen.

486
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,360
You're gonna get some funny looks.

487
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,590
And people are gonna say some stupid shit.

488
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,930
But if you're willing to love these kids who need a mom and dad,

489
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,660
and somebody has a problem with that,

490
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,470
you just ask 'em how many goddamn kids they've adopted.

491
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,370
Exactly. Hell.

492
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,710
I just wanted to have the Avatar talk. Now we did, so I'm good.

493
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,010
Oh, fantastic.

494
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,780
You ready to meet three kids? Three kids?

495
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,740
Yeah. All right. We'll set it up.

496
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,120
Hey. How's it going?

497
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,280
Uh, good. It's going really good.

498
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,720
Pete and Ellie. Yeah, we know. Come on in.

499
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,160
Good luck with that one. She thinks she's better than everybody.

500
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,130
Yeah. The other two are jackassing around out back.

501
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,870
We'll be in the shop.

502
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,070
Hey, uh, Mr. And Mrs. Wagner. How are you?

503
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,810
Oh, uh, Ellie and Pete.

504
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,640
You don't have to call us the Wagners. No, please. Good to...

505
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,250
Um, sorry about them. They're... Oh, please.

506
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,820
They just seem a little... Like brother and sister?

507
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,780
Pipe down with that crap. We are not friggin' related.

508
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,750
Friggin' related.

509
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,890
I'm really gonna miss them.

510
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,660
That is, if you... No. Please. Oh, my goodness.

511
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,820
You made such a good impression on us when we met you,

512
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,760
we wanted to get to know you a bit more.

513
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,560
Yes! Meet your brother and sister.

514
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,860
They're right outside, if you guys wanna follow me. Yes! Yes.

515
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,240
Juan. Lita.

516
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,680
I want you guys to meet Pete and Ellie.

517
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,140
Hi. Hey, guys.

518
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,480
Are we gonna go stay at your house now?

519
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,850
Well, we met your sister, and she's so awesome.

520
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,120
Yeah, she's really cool. She was telling us about you guys.

521
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,550
Want to play restaurant with me?

522
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,920
Yeah, I would love to.

523
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,690
Where's your restaurant? Right over there.

524
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,290
And what's your doll's name? Her name is Potato Chips.

525
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,130
I love potato chips. Potato chips are my favorite.

526
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,190
Nice one.

527
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,530
Can we be the Clippers? I'm more of a Lakers fan.

528
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,230
Oh, uh, sorry. You don't have to say sorry. That's okay.

529
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,800
We can be the Clippers. O-Okay.

530
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,470
I'm gonna shoot, you crash the boards. Yeah. Sure.

531
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,380
You did it on purpose! What?

532
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,580
You hit me 'cause I like the Clippers.

533
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,750
The Clippers are awesome. We love the Clippers. Are you kidding me?

534
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,500
It was so smart to get rid of Blake Griffin. That was a great trade

535
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:00,850
for them.

536
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,890
We're obsessed with the Clippers. I can't get enough of them.

537
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,190
They're amazing. Okay.

538
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,190
Can we play hide and seek? You sure? You lost a lot of blood.

539
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,930
I love hide and seek. Okay, but just us. No girls.

540
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,230
Oh. Sure.

541
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,170
It's not that progressive, but no problem.

542
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,370
Lita, should we go play restaurants? Yeah.

543
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,570
You're it. I'll hide and you count. Okay?

544
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,200
You sure you're okay? Yeah.

545
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,470
Go on, count. Count to 20. All right, buddy.

546
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,640
Oh, my God.

547
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,510
You better not embarrass me at the restaurant.

548
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,450
Potato Chips has been bad today. Bad girl!

549
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,180
Bad, bad, bad!

550
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,680
Don't talk back, you little beaner!

551
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,350
Oh! Uh... I don't think that's...

552
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,220
You know what? She picks up that stuff off the TV.

553
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,690
Yeah. Oh, don't give me the look.

554
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,100
Let's not call her bad names. Don't tell me how to treat my kid!

555
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,600
You think you're better than me, huh?

556
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,530
Pete, if you don't want the kids,

557
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,470
I'm not gonna push you into it.

558
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,470
All right, look.

559
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,480
I'm gonna be honest with you, all right?

560
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,440
I don't know, I just thought when we met our kids

561
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,950
that it would be like this cosmic connection, you know?

562
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,220
Like just take one look at them and just know, like when you and me met

563
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,250
Yeah. Totally.

564
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,950
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you didn't just know?

565
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,290
Hmm? Oh, my gosh.

566
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,220
What? You heard what I said. You didn't just know?

567
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,700
No, I was interested, but, you know, I'm more cautious than you are.

568
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,230
Really? Wow. How long before you just knew?

569
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,430
A couple of months.

570
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,400
A couple of months? How many months?

571
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,800
Like, four...

572
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,770
Four? ...teen.

573
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,610
Fourteen? Oh, my God!

574
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,770
I knew before we got married, okay? That's the point.

575
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,810
We don't have a year-long engagement on this thing.

576
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,240
If we say "yes," they're in our house next week.

577
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,650
Did you feel a cosmic connection?

578
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,780
No, I didn't feel a cosmic connection.

579
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,130
I felt like I was... I felt like I was babysitting other people's kids

580
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,220
I agree.

581
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,260
With what? With you.

582
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,720
With me wanting the kids or not wanting the kids?

583
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,890
Whatever you want. That's not an answer.

584
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,280
Then just give me 14 months to think about it. How 'bout that? Come on

585
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,560
Hi!

586
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,600
It's not a potluck.

587
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,770
All righty.

588
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,870
Honey, put those down for me. Thank you.

589
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,280
All right, come on, everybody.

590
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,940
Honey, come on. Jeez.

591
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,880
All right, everybody, hands.

592
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,150
Hands, hands, hands. Thank you.

593
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,290
Eyes closed.

594
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,390
I'm thankful for my beautiful grandchildren,

595
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,090
including the... the very lucky kids

596
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,930
that are soon to be adopted by two wonderful parents.

597
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,430
I'm really thankful for that too.

598
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,370
That is really inspiring stuff, you guys. Well done.

599
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,670
Yeah, about that. Actually, we...

600
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,700
Yeah, we've decided together not to move forward with the foster thing

601
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,110
Yeah, we just realized we hadn't thought it through properly, so...

602
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,950
Yeah! Jesus Christ. This is great news.

603
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,580
I mean, we were all being supportive to your faces, but...

604
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,680
Yeah. We all thought you were out of your minds.

605
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,890
I never said anything, but I'm thankful to hear this.

606
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,690
What? Why?

607
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,820
Ellie, let's not. We're holding hands. No, no, no, no.

608
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,830
I would be thankful to know why you all have a problem with this.

609
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,330
Hey, I never had a problem with it. I think it's smart.

610
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,640
Have a couple kids without the pregnancy and the hormones and the rage

611
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,100
Stop talking. Ellie.

612
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,710
All I'm saying is that we're thankful

613
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,770
that you and Peter are gonna experience

614
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,780
having the love of your own beautiful children rather than...

615
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,510
Rather than what, Jan? Just spit it out. Hell, I'll say it.

616
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,180
Rather than just rolling the dice

617
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,050
with the offspring of some criminal or drug addict.

618
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,990
To be honest, we were worried about our real kids' safety...

619
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:50,020
What? ...were they to hang out with your kids, if they're...

620
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,860
Damaged goods?

621
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,530
When I was growing up, a lot of people thought I was damaged goods too

622
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,830
Pete, we're not talking about you, man.

623
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,300
We're talking about crack babies and kids who have been sexually harassed.

624
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,830
"Sexually harassed"? What do you mean? Their parents made lewd comments?

625
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,410
You know what I mean, wiseass. Open your stupid eyes.

626
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,440
How long have everyone's eyes been open? Kimmy, you of all people.

627
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,880
What if you can't have a baby? Do not put that out into the universe, please.

628
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,450
What if you can't? What are you gonna do?

629
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,480
If you don't quit being so nuts about this baby thing,

630
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,180
I swear to God, I'm gonna get pregnant again this afternoon

631
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,720
just to spite you.

632
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,920
And you know I can do it. Really?

633
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,690
No. Oh.

634
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,560
I'm sorry if we're not as politically correct as you guys,

635
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,960
but our baby has to be our blood.

636
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,030
Yes! Absolutely! Oh, my God. "Our blood."

637
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,000
This blood? This blood right here? What's that supposed to mean?

638
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,800
Jerry, what do you think about this? I'd be thankful if we could eat, Russ.

639
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,770
You just spent 30 minutes talking about the deep state.

640
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,510
You don't have an opinion on your own family?

641
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,010
None of my business. Thank you, Daddy.

642
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,170
I would like you all to know that thousands of children

643
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,580
are spending Thanksgiving without any family at all.

644
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,710
And right now I kind of envy them. But I know you guys love me.

645
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,650
I know that I have a place to go to eat turkey and be thankful.

646
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,550
But a lot of kids don't have that.

647
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,550
And it's not their fault! And they're not damaged goods!

648
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,420
So forget what I said before. It is back on!

649
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,090
If that's okay with you, honey. Yee-haw, baby.

650
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,390
Yee-haw. We're gonna adopt a whole shitwhack of kids.

651
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,830
And I am thankful that whoever has a problem with it can fuck right off

652
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,800
Amen. Amen.

653
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,170
Well, there goes another Thanksgiving.

654
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,110
You're crazy.

655
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,340
Hi, honey. Here we are.

656
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,650
Come in, look around.

657
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,010
This is Meatball.

658
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,320
A Christmas tree?

659
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,920
Does that mean Santa comes here?

660
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,720
Yeah, every year. Yay!

661
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,060
So, you guys are rich. What? Ri... No.

662
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,860
We're not rich. I mean, we're doing okay.

663
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,960
Well... When we got this house, it was a dump.

664
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,630
That's what we do. We renovate houses. Ellie did all the design work.

665
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,470
Actually, everything is from swap meets and flea markets,

666
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,530
and it's not that expensive at all.

667
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,900
That's crystal! Sorry. Oh, my God. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

668
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,240
I'm so sorry. Uh, I shouldn't have left this out.

669
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,030
You guys want to see your rooms? Come on. Let's go check out your room

670
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:13,850
Lookit! A bed and a bunny! What do you think?

671
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,920
I love the bunny 'cause she has a skirt.

672
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,920
Whose toys are these? They're yours to share.

673
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
Yeah.

674
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,620
Lego!

675
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,410
Can I put my bears in there?

676
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,560
Sure. Of course.

677
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,830
Wow, you have a lot of teddy bears. These are just court bears.

678
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,400
They get one every time we go to family court.

679
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,170
Can you help me? Yeah.

680
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,240
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Look at this, Lita.

681
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,310
Lizzy, want me to show you your room?

682
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,080
Okay. Yeah. It's just here.

683
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,310
I'm so sorry you have to carry all your stuff in these awful bags.

684
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,610
If we knew... No, no, it's cool.

685
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,450
Fun fact: that's actually how you can spot a foster kid.

686
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,420
The kid carrying her whole life in a Hefty bag.

687
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,990
It's a foster joke.

688
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,690
Well, make yourself at home.

689
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,960
Yeah, this is your place. You can do whatever you want with it.

690
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,860
Do you wanna put posters on the wall, you wanna paint it?

691
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,230
Yeah. Come on, This is what we do. We can knock that out in 20 minutes.

692
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,040
We can run down to the hardware store, pick any color you like. What do you say?

693
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,800
Any color. Just pick a color.

694
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,130
what color do you like?   Any color you want

695
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:11,800
Anthing you want

696
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,680
You pick a color, we're doing it. You'd look great in green.

697
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,440
Yeah.

698
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:23,710
What do you think?

699
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,750
Wow, uh, it's, yeah, darkest of the black tones.

700
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,650
Yeah, that's what she picked. Dark Kettle Black, huh?

701
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,920
I like it. It's really... dope.

702
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,190
I'm gonna get dinner started. Okay.

703
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,200
She doesn't like it. I think she loves it.

704
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,630
Well, you know her better than I do.

705
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,800
Hey. Hey, you all done in there?

706
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,000
Oh, yeah. And... she loves it.

707
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,970
Oh, great. I'm so glad that she loves her black bedroom.

708
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,810
So, I'm gonna register Juan and Lita at Harding in the morning.

709
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,080
And then you can take Lizzy to the high school.

710
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,890
Did you see their shoes? We might want to take them to the mall tomorrow.

711
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,180
Hey, kids, dinner!

712
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,820
What? That sounds insane coming out of your mouth.

713
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,850
Do we have kids? Yeah, three of 'em.

714
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,120
That's insane! I don't believe it!

715
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,530
Did you not know that? 'Cause they're really here.

716
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,200
Holy shit. Holy shit. Yeah. Yeah.

717
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,360
They're here. I love you.

718
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,200
What? Kiss again! Kiss again!

719
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,240
God. Mmm!

720
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,440
What about that one? Kiss again! Kiss again!

721
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,780
It's gonna be long and weird.

722
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,080
How 'bout that? How 'bout that?

723
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,480
Come on, giggly. Sit down. I'm gonna shift the plates.

724
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,570
Great. We have everything. We have burgers and pasta and... Can

725
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,520
we have potato chips?

726
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,960
Let's get ready for the tub.

727
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,930
Uh, you two, come on. Who wants to...

728
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,590
Hey!

729
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,400
That's not really a bath toy.

730
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,130
I don't want this.

731
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,640
Oh, no! That's gonna... What? Hey! Hey!

732
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,680
I'm gonna get a hamper next time.

733
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,550
Hey, next time...

734
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,110
You need...? Lookit!

735
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,590
Grab... Hold it. Keep it over the sink, please.

736
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,860
Did you flush, sweetie?

737
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,600
Good night, kiddo. Good night.

738
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,910
Good night!

739
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,370
Should we give them a kiss good night? I don't know.

740
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,810
Maybe you should ask, or should we wait? Should I ask?

741
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,350
I'll ask. You guys are overthinking this.

742
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,380
Sorry, guys. Sorry.

743
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,080
Good night. Good night.

744
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,420
Good night!

745
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,290
Should we kiss Lizzy good night?

746
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,430
I'm good. Good night. Oh. Night, kiddo.

747
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,660
All right. Good night.

748
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,530
We try so hard to engage with him,

749
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,000
but no matter what we do, Jake just wants to hang out in his room,

750
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,170
talking on his phone, swearing, taking the Lord's name in vain,

751
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,470
and cranking his explicit music till all hours.

752
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,340
And he got into another fight at school.

753
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,710
Thank heaven he didn't seriously hurt one of the other kindergartners.

754
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,750
I think maybe it's okay for a five-year-old to have a cell phone.

755
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,750
But does he have a lot of contacts?

756
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,090
We tried to take it, but his birth mother gave it to him,

757
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,750
and if we touch it, it's just... Mmm.

758
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,420
I'm so sorry. You are so right.

759
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,690
He doesn't need a phone.

760
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,960
We're gonna try again. Definitely try.

761
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,800
Okay, and Pete and Ellie took in three children ten days ago,

762
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,970
one of which is a teenager.

763
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,070
Yeah, it's going pretty good.

764
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,410
I think our kids made us realize just what kind of a rut we were in before.

765
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,980
Not really a rut. Just the same old routine. You know?

766
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,980
Work, go to the gym, grabbing dinner, drinks, the movies.

767
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,180
You know what I mean. No, we don't know.

768
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,020
I think she's just trying to say that we needed a new challenge,

769
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,290
maybe something to break up the monotony.

770
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,330
That's not the only thing they're gonna break.

771
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,490
I know it sounds... I know everyone's going through tough stuff.

772
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,330
But these kids, I think they're really good. We got lucky.

773
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:31,630
They got lucky. Yeah, you hit the jackpot, lady.

774
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,270
Guys.

775
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,070
Why is this funny?

776
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,140
I think they might be recognizing a little bit of a honeymoon period.

777
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,370
No, we thought of that. But it doesn't feel like a period.

778
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,210
Well, I mean, it's not perfect.

779
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,750
Lita won't eat anything but potato chips.

780
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,210
But we got a plan to work on that too. I'm not saying we're perfect

781
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:51,620
parents.

782
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,120
Are you sure?

783
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,060
And I think I might be recognizing a little bit of jealousy.

784
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,520
It's not a good trait, guys.

785
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,730
Okay, what do we have here?

786
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,330
Huh? Christmas!

787
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,700
What is it? It's a sewing machine! What do you think?

788
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,940
No? She doesn't like it? Why not?

789
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,870
Looks like a robot, buddy! Lita, look at this big box!

790
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,410
Dude, it walks and talks. This could be my helmet!

791
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,780
What about the presents? I would've went crazy if I got a robot.

792
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,650
I'm playing with that robot. And this could be the spaceship.

793
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,320
Can I go inside? Sure.

794
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,820
Hey, guys. Wow, you really like cardboard boxes, huh?

795
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,120
Is anybody interested in playing with the giant dollhouse it took

796
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,330
three hours to assemble?

797
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,160
Did it come in a big box?

798
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,400
Yeah, it did. It came in a big $200 box.

799
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,600
Let's go! Let's go!

800
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,960
Come on. Let's go get the box.

801
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,500
Christmas is boxes. Yes.

802
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,870
Hey, Lizzy, this one's for you too.

803
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,770
Merry Christmas. Oh.

804
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,410
Another one. Yeah.

805
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,980
Thanks. Merry... Merry Christmas.

806
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,750
You didn't have to get all this stuff for us.

807
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,650
I know, I know, but we wanted to.

808
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:08,020
We were excited. Did we go overboard?

809
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,290
No, no, no! Um, I'm sorry.

810
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,390
I'm happy. I am. I...

811
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,190
It's nice to see Lita and Juan get presents

812
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,290
that weren't donated from total strangers, so...

813
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,230
Hey, Lizzy, if you ever want to talk about anything...

814
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,600
I know it's Christmastime and you may have memories and things.

815
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,100
Oh, no, no, no. I'm... I'm...

816
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,140
I'm good. I...

817
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,970
You know what? I just haven't had my morning coffee yet.

818
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,670
So I'm gonna get that.

819
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,670
Do you want some coffee? Sure.

820
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,960
We want to thank the Lord for our first Christmas together.

821
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,390
And we want to give thanks for this lovely meal and also this, um,

822
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,660
bounty of super fun cardboard boxes.

823
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,100
Amen. Amen.

824
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,000
Okay. Tuck in, everybody.

825
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,540
Where's my potato chips?

826
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,140
We're not having chips tonight, munchkin. Sorry.

827
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,070
I want my chips. Lita!

828
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,380
Pete and I worked really hard on this dinner.

829
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,080
There's lots of yummy food for you to eat.

830
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,710
No! Hey, hey, hey.

831
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,550
Hey! Lizzy, Lizzy, please! Lizzy, no, okay? I've got this.

832
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,100
Why are you yelling at me? I'm just trying to help you.

833
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,580
I'm not yelling at...

834
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,190
I'm sor... I am. Just then I was. But it's... Look.

835
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,440
Lita, don't do what Lizzy said. What did you say? C uatro? "Go to

836
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,120
your bedroom"?

837
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,560
No, cuatro means "quart." Like quart of milk.

838
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,430
She said, "You're not gonna have a potato chip, but you will drink

839
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:36,900
that milk."

840
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,500
In any case, we have this. It's fine.

841
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,800
Okay. Fine. Okay.

842
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,100
Let's try some of this meat loaf, okay?

843
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,870
No! I want my chips! You're not having chips!

844
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,840
I don't think she's getting on board with the plan, honey.

845
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,880
I don't want this! Hey!

846
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,040
You sure you don't wanna give her chips? No, we're not giving her chips.

847
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,090
Lita, stay right there!

848
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,990
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

849
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,260
No, it's okay. Don't cry. Relax.

850
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,790
Watch your feet, okay? Raised feet!

851
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,790
I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry.

852
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,090
You give those to me.

853
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,600
Ow! Ow. Calm down. Don't cry.

854
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,900
I want my chips!

855
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,760
Just stay there, Juan.

856
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,930
These are really, really good potatoes.

857
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,280
Oh, my God. Are you okay? Oh, God. Hold on.

858
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,410
Lita, duck!

859
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:31,110
What are you doing? Look, I'm trying to put it out!

860
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,080
With ketchup? Put it out!

861
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,820
All right. Lita?

862
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,820
Wait, wh-what's that noise?

863
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,960
Why is she growling? That wasn't in the classes. I got nothing for

864
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,190
that.

865
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,090
She's got a knife.

866
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,600
It's just a SpongeBob knife. It's still a knife.

867
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,900
Just put the knife down, honey.

868
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,530
Look, kid, just put down the weapon, okay?

869
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,670
You guys want me to deal with this, or do you still got it?

870
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,150
Do you wanna let her jump in here now, please? Okay, okay. Fine.

871
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,400
Fine!

872
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,840
Gracias.

873
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,580
Ellie, you gotta learn some Spanish.

874
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,950
Why would you give a kid milk in a glass cup? I'm sorry. I didn't.

875
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,790
Why did she do that? I hate her!

876
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,060
That didn't take long. They hate us already.

877
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,130
Well, technically, she said she hates you.

878
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,030
Okay, okay, okay! I want a Barbie!

879
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,770
This isn't even a real Barbie.

880
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,670
You've got a real Barbie that Santa gave you a few weeks ago.

881
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:39,470
Santa got me a fat Barbie! I want a skinny Barbie!

882
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,470
She's not fat. She's body positive.

883
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,210
If you put the doll back, I'll get you a giant ice cream sundae.

884
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,140
So you're rewarding this behavior?

885
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,250
What are you thinking? You handle it.

886
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,500
Juan, get out of there. Please? Don't hit me! Don't hit me! I'm sorry!

887
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,350
I didn't hit him, okay? I never have hit him.

888
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,920
I would never hit a kid. I want a Barbie!

889
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,260
Stop right now, or you're not getting lunch or dinner.

890
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,260
We're not starving people here, okay? I have this under control.

891
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,730
Yeah, Lizzy, you body-positive whore!

892
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:09,330
Okay, you're done. Gimme that. Give it to me. Just give me that now!

893
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh, yeah? Yeah, it really looks like you've got it.

894
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,500
Scan it! Hurry! No! We're not doing this!

895
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,310
Someone videotaping this? Pete, where are you? Where's Pete?

896
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:25,180
You're done. Oh, great. You're out there? Thank you so much.

897
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,480
Hey, sweetie. I brought the car.

898
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,750
Saved you a little walking time. We had a front space.

899
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,190
Well, it's still closer.

900
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,050
Hey, Pete, look at my pretty new doll. Wow.

901
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,250
So you caved, huh? No, I did not cave.

902
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,320
I bought it for her. It was only four bucks.

903
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:41,130
Can we just get out of here, you coward?

904
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,740
Holy shit. There they are.

905
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,910
Hey, Jan, Jerry. They're here.

906
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,810
Oh, man! Kid dinged a Porsche.

907
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,250
Dude, what are you doing? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

908
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,850
All right. Just don't cry, okay?

909
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,490
He's gonna have to leave a note.

910
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,990
Just help get the stuff out of the back. Lita! Lita! Honey.

911
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,960
Ellie looks dehydrated. She looks bad.

912
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,990
We've got the pizza! Juan, whoa, whoa. What are you doing, bud?

913
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,300
Oh, sorry! Oh, Christ.

914
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,530
It's so warm. Hey, put the pizza down.

915
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,830
You can't hold it like that. Hi, Mom.

916
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:25,970
Hey, Dad.

917
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:28,570
You must be Lizzy.

918
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:33,770
Yeah, hi. I'm Lizzy. Um, this is Lita and Juan.

919
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,040
Hello, Lita.

920
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,580
Hello, Juan.

921
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,250
I'm Grammy "Hw-an" and this is Grandpa "Hw-erry."

922
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,450
Mom, can you just talk like a normal person?

923
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,580
I like the way she says her J's.

924
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,720
Can you please? It's sophisticated.

925
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,390
Here you go, brother. Thanks, man.

926
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,060
I can't get over it. They look just like normal kids.

927
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,960
What did you think they were gonna look like? Little pirates?

928
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,730
I don't know. They're just so cute.

929
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,570
How is the new school?

930
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,600
It's good. It's like... It's, um... It's school.

931
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,300
Yeah. Awesome.

932
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,970
And what's the boy situation? Anything exciting?

933
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,810
No, no. Hey, hey, leave her alone.

934
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:17,210
She doesn't like talking about that kind of stuff, so just go easy.

935
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,850
What? You don't.

936
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:23,590
Actually, there's this one guy, Jacob. Yeah?

937
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,790
Wow, that's a cute name. Jacob. I like... Like Jake.

938
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,920
No, honey, it's "Hway-cob."

939
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,960
Right? Right? "Hway-cob."

940
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,790
No, no, it's just Jacob.

941
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,560
Yeah, and he's not cute.

942
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:41,000
He's more of like an artsy, old soul type.

943
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,940
I was never into the cute ones either.

944
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,940
Nah. Cute's overrated.

945
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,870
Right? I didn't either. I've never had a hot boyfriend, ever.

946
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,480
Shut up!

947
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,050
? You look like a monkey ?

948
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,180
? And you smell like one too ?

949
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,310
Lizzy, can we put the phone away while we're at the table, like we

950
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:07,960
talked about?

951
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,190
Lizzy, please. Give her the phone.

952
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:13,690
Hey, guys, check it out. There's some shit going down. Lizzy, the

953
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:14,000
phone.

954
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,100
Now.

955
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,470
Is that her real mom? Yeah, that's a harsh move.

956
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,070
Actually, if you read your foster parent regs,

957
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,810
you know you're not allowed to take away any of my personal property,

958
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:27,080
so...

959
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,240
It's the look. She's doing the look. I gotta get some ketchup.

960
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:35,110
Pete, you'd said you'd say something to her next time she acts all bitchy.

961
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,720
I never said the word "bitchy." It was her word, not mine.

962
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,190
I am always the bad guy because you're never there.

963
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,320
I'm not gonna apologize for working.

964
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,310
Somebody's gotta deal with that dump of a house you bought before it

965
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:44,690
bankrupts us.

966
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,960
I bought? You loved it too. And that's not even the point.

967
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,260
The point is, when you are there, you let them get away with murder.

968
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,760
I got on Lizzy just last night when she wouldn't clean up after

969
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,030
dinner!

970
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:54,000
Perfect parent, huh?

971
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,450
Is this funny, Kit? I think we're all enjoying this a little bit,

972
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,670
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay.

973
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,680
I never get tired of watching white people fight.

974
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,840
Nor do I.

975
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,810
But why don't you calm down

976
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,850
and tell us, without blaming each other, what the main issues are.

977
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,350
Well, Lita is just constantly...

978
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,980
I want... I don't want to!

979
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,050
And Juan just doesn't use his head.

980
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,990
Unlock the window! And if I say anything about any of it...

981
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,130
I'm so sorry. It's not my fault.

982
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,960
Lizzy's favorite pastime is just... Just leave me alone!

983
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,000
Thanks for making me late.

984
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,270
You're an asshole.

985
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,180
God forbid we actually try to parent the little ones. No, no, that's

986
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,770
her territory.

987
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:41,130
Don't forget, when Lizzy was ten her mother would disappear for weeks

988
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,040
at a time,

989
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,640
leaving Lizzy to parent Juan and Lita all by herself.

990
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,980
Yeah, she's not just gonna step aside and let you two take over.

991
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,800
Are you saying that we should let her parent the kids? Are you

992
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,520
paying attention?

993
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,120
She's 15. She's a terrible parent. She needs to be a kid.

994
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,750
Now, you gotta step up and become the parents.

995
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,660
But you just said she won't let us. Nope, she won't.

996
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,030
You know, Karen, you've been a godsend through most of this,

997
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,860
but you're just about to piss me off!

998
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:08,760
You won't get anywhere with her until you two get on the same page.

999
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,570
Right? That's right.

1000
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,370
If she's hostile with you again, maybe try using the three R's.

1001
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,540
Okay? Number one: regulate.

1002
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,210
"Lizzy, why don't you take some deep breaths, count to ten."

1003
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,140
Number two: relate.

1004
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:26,750
"I understand that you're upset. Nobody likes to feel this way."

1005
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,980
That's good. Number three: reason.

1006
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,390
"Lizzy, it's okay to be angry.

1007
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:36,020
What's not okay is to threaten to slash our throats

1008
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,260
in the middle of the night when we're asleep."

1009
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,130
I'm sorry, did I...?

1010
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,860
That was actually us.Our story.

1011
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,400
Yeah. Last session.

1012
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,330
The little guy didn't follow through with it though.

1013
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,100
Well, not yet! Not yet.

1014
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,610
Sorry, but we shouldn't be laughing.

1015
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,910
No, it's actually important to have a sense of humor about this kind of thing

1016
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,680
Right. You gotta laugh or you'll never make it through this.

1017
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,150
That is right.

1018
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:04,880
Speaking of which, next up we have October,

1019
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,580
who still hasn't been matched with a child.

1020
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,320
Well, there's some good news.

1021
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:15,560
So, together we're all gonna decide which chore we'd like to do

1022
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,560
and then each week we'll mix it up.

1023
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,760
Can I do "Feed Meatball"? Yes!

1024
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,100
I want to feed Meatball! You can feed him next week.

1025
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,200
Pete, I hope she's not serious about all this.

1026
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,650
It's not just she, it's we. And we are. Very serious.

1027
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,340
Okay, so do you want us to wash your feet too? Oh, Lizzy.

1028
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,440
This is bullshit! Lizzy! Hey, hey, wait, wait!

1029
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,780
Lizzy. Let's just... Let's... Let's try something else.

1030
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:41,010
Can we just take a moment, calm down, and take a few breaths?

1031
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,150
Please?

1032
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:44,880
Try it.

1033
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,760
Nice! Nice. And we hear you that you're frustrated with the chart.

1034
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,760
Well, yeah. Yeah, I'm frustrated.

1035
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,090
Yes! And that's okay to be frustrated! We're all frustrated.

1036
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,360
So let's think about next time how we can express ourselves better.

1037
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,540
Okay. Okay. Well...

1038
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,870
I don't know, maybe next time you guys...

1039
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,910
try and use the three R's on me.

1040
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,900
I could barf all over the ground because it's so nauseating!

1041
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,310
I knew it wasn't gonna work with her.

1042
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:18,150
Oh, good! You're home!

1043
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,350
Hi!

1044
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,720
Mom, I told you to text or call.

1045
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,880
You told me to give you a few weeks to settle in.

1046
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:27,220
Well, it's been a few weeks, and I want to meet my new grandkids.

1047
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,920
You must be Lizzy. Come here!

1048
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,320
No, she doesn't like it when you... Come here!

1049
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:33,830
Oh! I'm your Grandma Sandy.

1050
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,100
Anyone ever starts shit with any of you, they have to deal with me.

1051
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,770
We're family now, and I got your back forever. You hear me?

1052
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:42,570
Mom, just take it easy. Please. Oh, my God!

1053
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,070
Will you look at them!

1054
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,010
Juan, Lita, this is Sandy. This is Pete's mom.

1055
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,570
Hi! Hi!

1056
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,040
I could just eat you two up! And how's my baby boy?

1057
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,010
Ohh!

1058
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,120
Hello, dear. Hi.

1059
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,480
Mom, give us a few minutes. We were just in the middle of a family meeting.

1060
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,390
Perfect, because I'm a member of the family.

1061
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,760
Grandma Sandy has an announcement to make.

1062
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,860
I got the whole family tickets to Six Flags!

1063
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,920
Yay! Yay!

1064
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,530
What's Six Flags?

1065
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,430
"What's Six Flags?" Mom, that's such a nice offer.

1066
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:19,370
But things have been a little chaotic around here, and we need things to be normal.

1067
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:24,470
I'll tell you what's not normal, is your kids not knowing what Six Flags is.

1068
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,810
Your kids.

1069
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:31,280
Ma, it's just not a good time. So we're not doing this, okay?

1070
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,350
We're not doing this, right? We're on the same page because of the structure thing?

1071
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,780
Yeah, yeah.

1072
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,420
Honey? Right, El?

1073
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,720
I did not cave. Oh, you caved.

1074
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,930
Lizzy gave you the look and you caved.

1075
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:52,130
Maybe I just wanted to be the fun parent for once instead of being the bad guy.

1076
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,670
I tried being the bad guy. You wouldn't let me. Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

1077
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,730
But look how much fun everybody's having.

1078
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,970
And Lizzy, she's actually smiling. It's crazy.

1079
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,640
Hey! Did you have fun?

1080
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,470
You don't have to go on the kiddie rides.

1081
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,480
I love the big rides. You want to go on the...

1082
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,550
Hey, Lizzy! Hey, what's up?

1083
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,750
Good to see you! Good to see you too!

1084
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,490
Hey, hey. What's up?

1085
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,720
Uh, Kylie, Savanna, these are my, um...

1086
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,590
fosters.

1087
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,660
Yeah, yeah. We're the fosters!

1088
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,260
I'll see you guys later. Actually, we were just gonna go on the water ride.

1089
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,230
Let her go with her friends.

1090
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:32,200
They don't want to be stuck here with a bunch of old farts like you two.

1091
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,500
They want to ride the big stuff and check out the hot boys.

1092
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,700
Here's a hundred.

1093
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,900
Buy yourselves some souvenirs and junk food.

1094
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:43,410
Uh-huh. Thanks, Grandma Sandy. Thanks!

1095
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,110
All right, cool.

1096
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:48,910
Uh, meet you guys at... What time are we going back to your house?

1097
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,750
We're going back to our house, where we all live, at 7:00!

1098
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,790
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye!

1099
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:58,560
Mom, what are you doing? You can't... Oh, no!

1100
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,330
Little Juanny's upchucking in the trash bin!

1101
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:03,430
You all right, peanut?

1102
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:06,260
Was it all the funnel cakes we ate?

1103
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,830
Oh. Oh, oh.

1104
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:21,610
I know she's getting these texts. I can see the dots.

1105
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,910
Maybe she ran off. Maybe something happened to her.

1106
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:28,180
No, she didn't. She's just treating us like another set of fosters.

1107
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,920
All right, bye.

1108
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,720
Thanks for the ride. I love you!

1109
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,590
I'm the bad guy. Watch this. Bye.

1110
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,060
Bye! Hey!

1111
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,830
Where the hell were you? We went to the movies.

1112
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,100
And it ran a little bit later. It's not a big deal.

1113
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,030
You couldn't have taken five seconds to let us know nobody murdered you?

1114
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,270
Well, guess what? You're grounded.

1115
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,370
I'm grounded? Yeah. You're grounded. Because I just grounded you.

1116
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,440
Before you weren't grounded, you weren't anything,

1117
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,710
and then I just said that thing that I said, and now you're grounded!

1118
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,980
We've been waiting one hour for you! I'm the bad guy. Calm down.

1119
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,640
He's the bad guy. You're not going anywhere.

1120
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,110
You're done! Done!

1121
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,680
Don't want to hear it! You know what?

1122
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,580
When I was nine I lived in a crack house.

1123
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:10,950
So I'm pretty sure the multiplex is a comparatively safe environment.

1124
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,690
Oh, no. No. You don't play that trouble pass card with us.

1125
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,790
Your butt's in a sling, missy!

1126
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,960
Oh, Grandma Sandy, I forgot. What?

1127
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,960
I got you, um...

1128
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,260
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1129
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,600
Will you look at this? I'm gonna wear it every day.

1130
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,800
Oh, come here.

1131
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,470
You know, this reminds me

1132
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:34,670
of when Pete and his degenerate friends stole a pizza truck.

1133
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,340
She's good. She's good. Oh, God.

1134
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,050
Are you two gonna stand there all night,

1135
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:42,280
or are we gonna try to get these kids to bed at a decent hour?

1136
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,750
You remember I told you we weren't special enough for this?

1137
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,020
We were doing fine. You said that we were in a rut.

1138
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,220
Maybe we were spoiled and didn't appreciate the rut.

1139
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,260
The rut was easy and quiet. You know, I miss the rut. But you had to be a mommy.

1140
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,620
Whose idea was it to go and talk to the teenagers?

1141
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:57,330
We could've had a toddler who doesn't have opinions and thong underwear.

1142
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:59,900
What? You pushed us into some next-level shit!

1143
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,000
Look, we can't start turning on each other here.

1144
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,570
If we just stay calm and we work together,

1145
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,940
we can find a way to get these little assholes out of our house!

1146
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,170
Now we're talking!

1147
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,140
That's exactly what I was thinking. Hello!

1148
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,040
I hate them so much. Me too. They're the worst.

1149
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,580
They're so ungrateful. We're doing everything for them.

1150
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,480
And they could give two shits. Right?

1151
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,250
But guess what? They're not adopted yet.

1152
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,920
No. No, they're not.

1153
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,160
We could just...

1154
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,320
put 'em back.

1155
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:31,960
I mean, yes, we would look like the worst people in the world, but...

1156
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,360
Yeah, we would. And right now everybody thinks we're saints.

1157
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,100
I know. I love that part. I do love that part. That's the only good part.

1158
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,030
Just an idea.

1159
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,470
What if we say that some relatives came forward?

1160
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:46,070
The courts took 'em. There's nothing we could do.

1161
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:49,370
Right? We squirt a few tears, we act super devastated.

1162
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,380
That's good. That's good. That's very good.

1163
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,510
And we get our clean house and date night back.

1164
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:57,580
And everybody feels sorry for us.

1165
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,680
Yes! Right?

1166
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,320
Get some presents maybe.

1167
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,090
We're never gonna do that.

1168
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,430
No.

1169
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,230
It's a nice thought, but we're...

1170
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:17,460
We're stuck, aren't we? Yeah, we are.

1171
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,730
You know, we gotta just accept that we made a terrible mistake

1172
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,410
and our life is mostly gonna suck now.

1173
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,770
Good night, honey.

1174
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,860
All right, one nail on each side of the slat.

1175
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,330
Okay. On both ends. Okay?

1176
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,530
"Look." Yes, excellent.

1177
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,670
Okay, keep going. Get the words for me.

1178
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:59,540
What are you doing? You want to get in? You wanna say hi to Lizzy?

1179
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,870
Speak of the devil.

1180
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,770
What are they doing here?

1181
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,640
You never said I couldn't have any people over.

1182
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,750
Everybody knows you can't have people over when you're grounded.

1183
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:14,820
You know that too, because they obviously came in through the window.

1184
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,350
This place is disgusting, by the way.

1185
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:19,490
God, what a Nazi bitch. What did you call me?

1186
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:21,620
I don't know. You just seem like a Nazi bitch.

1187
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,560
Get out. Now.

1188
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,790
Out. Both of you, out. Go! Now! No, you get out of my room.

1189
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,130
No, no, I'm staying in your black room. These guys are leaving.

1190
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,500
No, out the window, Pussy Riot! Way you came in!

1191
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,000
Out, now! Holy shit!

1192
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,130
Out! Out!

1193
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,340
Oh! You're literally crazy!

1194
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:41,210
You're driving me crazy! Oh, my God. What are you doing?

1195
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:44,310
You're acting like you're a psychopath. Start the car.

1196
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:47,280
What is going on in there? Lizzy, please, I said you're grounded.

1197
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,980
Where are you going? I'm calling my caseworker.

1198
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,950
That's a good idea, huh?

1199
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:54,320
Get CPS to come, make your little brother and sister pack up their court bears

1200
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,950
and trash bags in the middle of the night and move them back to the Muskies?

1201
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,190
That'll be really good for them. Better than you.

1202
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:02,530
No! Not better than me! I can't with you. Can you please deal with her, Pete?

1203
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:05,190
Hey, Lizzy, you're gonna... We're really good people!

1204
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,960
We just want to make a nice home for you. Is that so wrong?

1205
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:10,870
You're just another white lady who wants to adopt little charity orphans

1206
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,440
to make you feel good about yourself.

1207
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,970
Pete, you tell her what my nationality is! Tell her!

1208
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,670
Well, actually by blood she is...

1209
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:19,470
I'm one-eighth Comanche, okay? So I'm not that white!

1210
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,710
And do I look like I feel good about myself right now?

1211
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:23,410
Okay, then tell me! Please tell me!

1212
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:26,210
Why did you suddenly feel the urge to get foster kids?

1213
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,850
Because we... It was... I mean, I...

1214
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,080
"Pete, please?" Exactly. No, I...

1215
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:34,150
Hey, you're not going anywhere. Stop right there!

1216
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,920
I mean it. Don't open that door.

1217
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,330
Hey! Do not get in that car. You hear me?

1218
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,230
Don't shut that door. I mean it!

1219
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:43,960
Good. Now can we just go inside so we can talk about this?

1220
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,030
Juan, drop it right now!

1221
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:08,750
What are you doing? Take it out!

1222
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:12,460
No, better to leave it in till we get to the hospital. You're okay, buddy. We're here.

1223
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,960
We're here. You're okay.

1224
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,860
Stay still. I got to wrap it up.

1225
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,560
Relax. We'll get you there in one second, okay? You're...

1226
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,790
Oh, honey, Juan is gonna be okay. Come on.

1227
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,070
You know what? Tell the girls we need their car. Now!

1228
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:30,510
Get out! Move your ass! Come on!

1229
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:34,940
I got you, buddy. I got you. Get in, get in, get in.

1230
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,840
Seat belts on, everybody! Seat belts on.

1231
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:39,740
You're a brave boy, you hear me? Look at me. You're so brave. Yeah?

1232
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,710
You're doing such a good job, buddy. We're right here.

1233
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,150
Hello! Hey, help, please.

1234
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,020
What happened? He's got a nail in his foot.

1235
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,850
I didn't want to take it out, just in case.

1236
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,620
That was very smart. Put him right on this gurney.

1237
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:53,660
Hey, buddy. It's all right, buddy. We're here.

1238
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,160
Are you the mother? Yes. Oh, I'm his foster mom.

1239
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,030
Okay. Right this way, Dad.

1240
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,760
Hey, buddy, what's your name?

1241
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,430
Juan, we're gonna clean this off, give you a little anesthetic,

1242
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:04,500
and then take this nail out.

1243
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,240
Hold my hand. Gonna be a little pinch. Look at me.

1244
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,310
Hold my hand, hold my hand. A little bit of a sting.

1245
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:12,570
Stop! Stop! It's almost over.

1246
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,240
That's it. It's done! It's done. It's done.

1247
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,950
I think we should take Lita to the lobby.

1248
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,610
You want to go with her or stay here with Juan?

1249
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,320
You take her.

1250
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:32,420
Come here. Hey, I'm right here.

1251
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,960
He's okay. You're so brave.

1252
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,800
You're doing so good, buddy.

1253
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,270
So he doesn't have to wear a cast or anything? It's just stitches?

1254
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:45,840
Yeah. Well, that's good news.

1255
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,310
And how did this happen?

1256
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,940
It was my fault. I walked away, and I left the gun there.

1257
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:55,680
Juan just picked it up. No. It wasn't their fault. It was mine.

1258
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,180
I was trying to leave in a car and I wasn't supposed to,

1259
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,820
and then they got distracted, and then I yelled at Juan,

1260
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,620
and he dropped the thing on his foot...

1261
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,720
Don't be ridiculous. I should never have left the nail gun there.

1262
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,960
Pete, shut up! This is the kind of stuff they move kids for, okay?

1263
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,020
It wasn't their fault. They didn't do anything.

1264
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,560
I should be the one getting in trouble right now. It's okay.

1265
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,430
Why don't you come on over here? Excuse me.

1266
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:18,000
And, uh, let's talk about what happened.

1267
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:26,410
So, uh, nobody's being moved.

1268
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:37,650
Hey. What's wrong?

1269
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:41,620
Uh, I have no idea. I just woke up this morning and...

1270
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,090
Damn it.

1271
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,330
You know what? I think I can help.

1272
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,700
I have a...

1273
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,430
I have this really great detangler. You want me to...?

1274
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,470
Sure, yeah. Yeah, whatever, yeah. Yeah?

1275
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:58,300
Okay, here.

1276
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,800
Have a seat, and I'll... Yeah.

1277
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,270
Okay.

1278
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,180
Wow. How'd this happen? I don't know.

1279
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:10,080
Yeah. Just let me know if it pulls, okay?

1280
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,790
Okay. That's good.

1281
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:23,820
Better, yeah? Oh, wow. Yeah. Thank you.

1282
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,090
Let me just smooth it out for you.

1283
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,190
Thank you.

1284
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,990
No problem. It's all gone.

1285
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,910
You all set? Yep.

1286
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:22,840
Hey, thanks for the lunch. No problem.

1287
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:27,050
Oh, is that that boy Jacob?

1288
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,450
The one that just picked up that bit of trash?

1289
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:33,020
Don't freak out about it. No! Why would I freak out about it?

1290
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,250
He looks like an artistic type, like you said.

1291
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,290
You think so? Definitely!

1292
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,820
Look at that face. Yeah.

1293
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:41,190
Conscientious. Picking up trash.

1294
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:44,090
Yeah. Yeah, he is. Yeah.

1295
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,600
Well, have a good day. Thanks. You too.

1296
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,170
Okay. All right.

1297
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:51,900
Careful with your foot, Juan. Bye, Lita.

1298
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:53,340
Well, did you see that?

1299
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,740
Definitely starting to hate me a bit less, right?

1300
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:58,140
Maybe.

1301
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,150
Hi, Lizzy. Hey, Charlie.

1302
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:05,180
Hi, Jacob.

1303
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,680
Wassup, baby girl? Nothing.

1304
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:12,320
How you doing? I'm good. Cleaning up your mess.

1305
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:18,160
Why don't you get into school before you get me in trouble.

1306
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,060
All right, fine.

1307
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,900
Text me. Okay.

1308
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,010
Hey, hon. Hey.

1309
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,180
Hi. How's she doing? She's good.

1310
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,080
Oh. Yeah. And check this out.

1311
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,360
I got here early, Lizzy saw me, and she came over and just starts

1312
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:42,880
talking.

1313
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,750
To you? Yeah!

1314
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:47,550
Not, like, full-on girl talk, but not the usual silent treatment either.

1315
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,690
She was telling me about that kid Jacob,

1316
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:52,460
and how he doesn't say much so she can't tell if he likes her.

1317
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:55,090
Next thing I know I'm in full mom mode, giving her advice, like,

1318
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,410
"Well, sometimes with the quiet types you'll have to make the first move."

1319
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,870
You said "make a move"? You told her to make a move on a boy?

1320
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,770
This kid is harmless, baby. Trust me.

1321
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,840
I'm thrilled she even likes him. I totally pegged her for the bad boys.

1322
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:11,310
What happened? Juan broke Potato Chips.

1323
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:14,610
Calm down. I'm gonna fix her, okay? Here you go. See?

1324
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,080
Thanks, Daddy.

1325
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,950
Did you hear that? I just got my first "Daddy"!

1326
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:23,080
That's... You suck!

1327
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:25,450
No fair! I want some of that. Hey, honey.

1328
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:28,320
Lita, can I help you with anything? Nope!

1329
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,960
No, what? Are you talking to me? Who am I?

1330
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,030
Ellie. Juan. Buddy, come here!

1331
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,300
Come here, Son.

1332
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,860
How's your foot? You okay? You okay if I call you "Son"?

1333
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,500
Sure.

1334
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,270
Where's Lizzy? Right there. See her?

1335
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,640
Oh, yeah, she's right there.

1336
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,750
She just comes out here, she takes all this stuff out,

1337
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:36,620
and she can't bother with the one second it takes

1338
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,680
to close a stupid door or put anything in the sink.

1339
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:42,520
What happened? I found my hairbrush in the toilet this morning.

1340
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,520
What? I told you that wasn't me!

1341
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,160
Of course it was you. I left it in the bathroom for you.

1342
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:51,390
Juan and Lita aren't even up yet. I'm up now, Miss Noisy Pants.

1343
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,930
I'm sorry, sweetie. I thought we were really connecting.

1344
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:57,370
I left it there for her with a nice little note, with hearts on it and stuff.

1345
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:59,070
Oh, my God. I didn't do it.

1346
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:00,640
Wow. Hello. What is that?

1347
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,440
You're wearing that? Are you going to a strip club?

1348
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,810
Sorry I don't dress like an uptight douche like you.

1349
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,780
You don't talk to my wife like that! This is from Ann Taylor. Loft!

1351
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,080
You know what? Go put some clothes on, a lot of them.

1352
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,380
Then get in my truck. I'm driving you this morning. Oh, my God!

1353
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,050
You guys are so annoying!

1354
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:17,620
Change the clothes. It's not that big of a deal.

1355
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:19,620
Hey. Do I dress like a douche?

1356
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,590
No. Make sure she gets out to my truck. Bye, Daddy.

1357
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:24,660
Bye, sweetie.

1358
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:34,270
Oh, my goodness. Oh.

1359
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:39,170
Hey, what's that? Oh!

1360
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,880
You okay?

1361
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,480
That's a shame.

1362
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:59,790
What are we doing here? Let's go.

1363
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:02,530
I'm gonna be late for school, you know.

1364
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,500
Come on.

1365
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,800
Okay. So you're punishing me with manual labor.

1366
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,760
I've worked harder than you've ever...

1367
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,270
Yeah, I know, you're a badass.

1368
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:15,600
This isn't a punishment, okay? Hey!

1369
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:19,510
I'm Stewart. You probably... You... What's up?

1370
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:21,940
Stewart. Don't ever talk to her again, okay?

1371
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:25,180
As a matter of fact, go to lunch. It's 8:15.

1372
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,480
Okay. Lunch it is.

1373
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,720
Come on.

1374
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,290
Put these on. What?

1375
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:36,720
Just put them on.

1376
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:38,860
Lizzy, I know you're angry.

1377
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:42,260
At us, at the world. Maybe at yourself a little bit.

1378
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,330
I don't know, and you're not talking.

1379
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:47,070
Truth is, when I'm pissed, I don't like to talk about it either.

1380
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:50,030
But you know what I do like to do?

1381
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,140
Oh! I like to break shit.

1382
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,670
R... Really?

1383
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:56,280
Anything in this room.

1384
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,240
Swing away. Okay.

1385
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:05,410
Huh? How'd that feel? It felt good!

1386
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:07,350
Feels good, huh? I told you. Yeah.

1387
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:12,990
Now... Whoa, whoa! Don't waste it, all right? I want you to do me a favor.

1388
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:15,990
I need you to think about something that really pisses you off.

1389
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:18,960
You got it? I got it.

1390
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:21,030
Let's see it. Bust that shit up.

1391
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:22,500
Yes!

1392
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,900
There you go. You like that? Yeah, that was good.

1393
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,600
All right, come on.

1394
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:31,170
There we go. Yes!

1395
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:49,790
Ho-ho! Double shot!

1396
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,400
You like that?

1397
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:04,870
That was cool.

1398
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:15,010
So no school today, huh?

1399
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,940
Pete took me to the house you're flipping. Hmm.

1400
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:20,150
We did some demo work. That's cool.

1401
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:22,320
Um, hey, hey, come on.

1402
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,860
About that hairbrush?

1403
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:33,400
my mom used to brush my hair...

1404
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,100
and I don't know, I'm sorry.

1405
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,200
It's okay. I'm sorry too.

1406
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,970
No, you have no reason to be sorry. No, I'm really sorry.

1407
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,410
All right.

1408
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:54,340
I'm gonna go clean up. Hairbrush is in the toilet, if you need it.

1409
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:57,720
Good one.

1410
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:03,290
Thank you.

1411
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,970
You wanna rotate like this, okay?

1412
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:21,470
Yeah.

1413
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,500
Juan hit me!

1414
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,610
Oh, no. Oh, God!

1415
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,650
Hey, number three, where's your mother?

1416
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:39,620
I'm okay. Okay.

1417
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:40,850
I didn't hit her!

1418
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,750
Juan, where did you put my phone?

1419
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,520
I didn't take your phone! No, I didn't!

1420
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:16,720
All right! First try!

1421
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,700
-Tres  -Tres
Tres. Tres.

1422
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,240
There you go. Dad, Dad, Dad!

1423
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,920
There you go, Juan.

1424
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,520
Spit it out, spit it out!

1425
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,290
Here, water! No, we need ice!

1426
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:58,360
Water, water. Here. Oh, gosh.

1427
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,940
Hey.

1428
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:15,570
Hey, buddy.

1429
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:19,170
Hey, hey, hey.

1430
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:22,540
Hey. It's okay, sweetie. Did you have a bad dream?

1431
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:24,110
Yeah. Yeah?

1432
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:26,350
You're okay. You're safe and sound in your bed.

1433
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:27,950
You're good.

1434
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:34,520
Good night, buddy.

1435
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,890
Good night, Mommy.

1436
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,430
What?

1437
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:48,670
What did you say?

1438
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:50,870
Juan, what did you say?

1439
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:53,640
Did you say something, Juan?

1440
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,400
Hey, Juan, what did you say?

1441
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:57,010
Juan!

1442
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,510
Juan! Did you say something? Juan!

1443
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:02,910
Juan, what did you say?

1444
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:04,620
Juan!

1445
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:10,690
Oh, my God.

1446
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,090
Good night, buddy.

1447
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:32,010
Hey. Hey!

1448
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:34,240
Wow, it's looking good. Huh? You like it?

1449
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,980
Check it out. I put the storage at the end of the island, like you suggested.

1450
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:40,180
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1451
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,450
Great idea, by the way. It's awesome.

1452
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:45,880
Why don't you come help us hang some tile? Yeah.

1453
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:47,520
No, I, uh...

1454
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,960
So, there's, um...

1455
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:52,350
There's something I'd like to do,

1456
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,860
and I was hoping I could get your help setting it up.

1457
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:57,990
Sure. What are we setting up? Of course. Anything.

1458
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,230
So I was talking to Karen and Sharon, and they...

1459
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,170
Uh, my mom got out a few months ago, so...

1460
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:10,340
And I haven't seen her. I was hoping I could see her.

1461
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:12,740
Yeah, sure. Yeah, of course.

1462
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:14,980
Of course. I mean, that's... Yeah.

1463
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,640
Cool. Thanks.

1464
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:19,210
Yeah. It's cool. Great.

1465
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,280
Okay. Thanks.

1466
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,220
You, uh...

1467
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:28,290
I'll just wait outside. Okay.

1468
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:40,800
Mom!

1469
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,410
Hi.

1470
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:50,940
Hi, Mom.

1471
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:56,380
Juan, Lita.

1472
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,650
Hey, Juan, Lita, come on!

1473
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,420
Come on.

1474
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:05,650
What's wrong? Come on. I want to stay with Mom.

1475
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:07,420
Your mommy's over there.

1476
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:09,460
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay, honey.

1477
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,490
We're gonna go with you. We're right here.

1478
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:14,160
We'll walk together. Come on.

1479
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:19,130
Slow down.

1480
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,900
Oh, my babies, you got so big!

1481
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,800
Come, mi amor.

1482
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:28,070
Hi, I'm Sue. I'm Carla's caseworker.

1483
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,910
You must be Pete and Ellie? Yeah, I'm Pete. Hi.

1484
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,280
Hey. I'm Ellie.

1485
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:37,050
This is Carla. She's... Their mom.

1486
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:40,750
Hi. I'm Ellie. Nice to meet you.

1487
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,860
I'm Pete.

1488
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:49,860
Hey, I wanted to say thank you for watching them while I was...

1489
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:51,760
No problem. They've been doing great.

1490
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,400
Juan started playing piano. Right, buddy?

1491
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,630
And Lita just got 100 on her last spelling test.

1492
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,340
And Lizzy's soccer team is undefeated.

1493
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:01,810
All right, so you guys gonna pick us up at 4:00?

1494
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:05,180
Okay. We'll see you in a bit.

1495
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,340
Yeah, we'll be back. We'll be back soon.

1496
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,150
Bye, guys. Nice to meet you.

1497
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:22,020
You okay?

1498
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:25,830
"Thanks for watching them"? Like we've just been fricking babysitting for five months?

1499
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:28,560
She's just not what I pictured at all.

1500
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,700
She's... She kind of looks normal.

1501
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:35,170
I feel bad, like we're breaking up a family.

1502
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,640
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1503
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,340
The courts did. And don't forget why.

1504
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:42,070
Those kids were living like feral cats in a crack house.

1505
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:46,280
I know, I know, but she kind of... She looks okay.

1506
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,850
I mean, Sharon said she's been clean for four months.

1507
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:51,920
Yeah, she got clean because she was in jail, Ellie.

1508
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,050
Look at the way Lizzy's looking at her.

1509
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,190
She's still her mom.

1510
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:02,690
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1511
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,260
So I said, "Young lady,

1512
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,100
we hear about you throwing food in the cafeteria one more time,

1513
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:13,730
and you're gonna have a couple of lunch dates."

1514
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:16,070
Next day, the behavior continued.

1515
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:19,140
So we went to the school and joined her in the cafeteria.

1516
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,780
Chattin' up all her middle school BFFs.

1517
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:26,510
I walked them through some of my better bird-watching stories.

1518
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,220
They were completely uninterested.

1519
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,420
But that food throwing has stopped!

1520
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:33,620
Good. Good.

1521
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,120
Would you like to share your news?

1522
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:40,960
About the couch fire? No. About your .26 hearing.

1524
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,130
Yes.

1525
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:46,830
The court has legally cleared us...

1526
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:51,170
to adopt.

1527
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:55,110
To adopt Tina and Ryan!

1528
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:58,010
Yay! That is so great.

1529
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:01,010
Congratulations, guys. I'm so happy for you.

1530
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:05,910
That is such great news. I'm so happy for both of you.

1531
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,390
And next we have Pete and Ellie.

1532
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:14,020
Well, you know, our kids have, what,

1533
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:16,820
had now four visits with their birth mom?

1534
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:18,460
Yeah. And every time they do,

1535
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,330
they're just crazy for a few days after.

1536
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:25,030
Holy...

1537
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:28,400
And just when things finally start to feel normal again,

1538
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,840
they have another visit.

1539
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,140
Yeah, we just feel so rejected.

1540
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:37,180
And I know this probably makes me a really bad person,

1541
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:40,950
but I just keep wishing that their mom would go back to prison.

1542
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,610
You're not a bad person.

1543
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:45,350
When someone does terrible things to the children we love,

1544
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:47,690
it's not easy to find empathy for them.

1545
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,090
But we have to try, people.

1546
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:53,960
Whatever happens, the time that your kids spent with you

1547
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,260
made a big difference in their lives. Mm-hmm.

1548
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:59,330
Yeah, I know, but then we're just supposed to...

1549
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:04,100
Wait. Did you say "made" a difference? Yeah, she did.

1550
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,940
We-We'll talk after.

1551
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:08,700
No. She said "made." That's past tense. There's a difference.

1552
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:10,370
I wanna know what's going on, Karen.

1553
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,140
Well...

1554
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:17,810
Since Lizzy's mom has been keeping up with her reunification steps,

1555
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:23,180
the judge changed your .26 hearing to a Change of Circumstances hearing

1556
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:27,450
where he'll decide if the kids are ready to reunite.

1557
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:29,260
Nice.

1558
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:31,290
Really nice.

1559
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:33,460
No, this is...

1560
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,330
You weren't gonna share that with us?

1561
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:37,930
We've been dealing with all of this shit!

1562
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:40,530
I mean, the tantrums, the messes, the attitude.

1563
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:43,370
I have played 150 games of Candy Land with Lita.

1565
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:45,170
You ever play fricking Candy Land?

1567
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:47,070
It's brutal! It's very dull.

1568
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:48,720
We're making connections. Okay?

1569
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,740
I mean I just taught Lita how to ride a bike.

1570
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:53,110
Juan and I bonded over Rocky III.

1572
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:55,380
And now Mom's ready to reunite?

1573
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:58,920
Pete, Ellie, I understand your frustration.

1574
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:04,090
But we all need to keep in mind that until the kids are adopted,

1575
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:09,030
the primary goal of the system is family preservation.

1576
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,690
And what about preserving our family? Yeah.

1577
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:15,400
Nothing has been decided yet.

1578
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:21,770
All right, October, that leaves you.

1579
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,640
Well, I have gotten a placement.

1580
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:29,880
Oh. He is 14 and does play JV basketball.

1581
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,810
But he is 5'2."

1583
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:34,810
And white, with red hair.

1584
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:38,450
Absolutely no fundamentals whatsoever.

1585
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:41,290
Oh, I get it. My problems seem stupid now.

1586
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:44,120
Why do I always have to go last?

1587
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,160
Stop. Okay. I know. It's...

1588
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,790
It's very unprofessional.

1589
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,710
This is the opposite of a support group.

1590
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:06,210
What am I gonna look like?

1591
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:09,380
You're gonna look like a beautiful princess. Oh!

1592
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:12,110
Do I look like a flower?

1593
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,650
Hey. Hey, hey, buddy.

1594
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:17,390
Mom. Hey, kids. Oh! Hi, honey!

1595
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:19,390
Hey. Mom!

1596
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:21,520
No, no, no. It's totally washable.

1597
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,860
It's, um... That's a Sharpie.

1599
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:26,790
Oh, yeah. Oh, dear.

1600
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,000
Can you please get off the counter, honey? It's dangerous.

1601
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,330
How was care group? So much fun.

1602
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:35,940
Hey, hey, hey. We have news.

1603
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:38,170
You're pregnant? Oh, my God!

1604
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:40,040
Why are you doing this to me? I'm sorry. No?

1605
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,570
It's okay. No. Just tell them.

1606
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:43,570
Yeah? Uh-huh.

1607
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,280
Okay, okay.

1608
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,210
We are going to adopt through foster care, just like you guys!

1609
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:50,550
I mean, we did not get it at first,

1610
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:54,520
and then we met yours and saw what a wonderful choice it was.

1611
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,920
Hell of a lot cheaper than in vitro too.

1612
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:00,860
Which is not the reason, but it's a reason, if you're weighing factors.

1613
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,830
And we start classes next week!

1614
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:04,890
What do you guys think?

1615
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:09,000
I think, uh...

1616
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:12,900
I think I have to take a crap.

1617
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:16,070
That's not the reaction we were looking for on that.

1618
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:16,470
She's jealous!

1619
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:18,710
Oh! Hey! Oh, my God! What are you doing?

1620
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:21,580
What's going on? Please give this to me. Lizzy!

1621
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,480
You're not allowed to take my phone! What's she doing?

1622
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,680
God! She's taking naked selfies in the bathroom!

1623
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:28,350
She's taking naked selfies of herself? What are you doing to my phone?

1624
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:31,380
I'm deleting everything here! Delete, delete, delete.

1625
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:33,280
How many photos did you take? What is wrong with you?

1626
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:35,030
Everyone does it! It's no big deal!

1627
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:36,490
It's a big, huge, giant deal!

1628
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:38,720
Fifteen-year-old girls should never be naked, ever!

1629
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:42,730
Can you take the door? Don't read my texts! Open the door!

1630
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:45,360
"If you don't show me something soon, I might lose interest."

1631
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:48,070
What? Who is this person, Lizzy? Open the door!

1632
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:51,870
Oh, no. No, no. Dick pic! There's a dick pic!

1633
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:54,540
Come on, kids, we are going in the living room.

1634
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,570
Is this that kid Jacob you were talking about?

1635
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:59,280
That sweet kid from school is sending you photos of his beeswax?

1636
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,580
Jesus, that is a trout!

1638
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:02,610
Get out of here!

1639
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:05,150
Lizzy! Get out here now!

1640
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:09,850
Give me the phone! Let go!

1641
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:13,340
This is not cool Lizzy! I don't have to listen to you anymore,

1642
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:13,950
Pretend Mom!

1643
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,430
This isn't...

1644
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,070
Still think it's a wonderful choice?

1645
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:31,870
Our foster kids aren't gonna act like that.

1646
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:32,670
That's on you guys.

1647
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:36,840
What exactly is a dick pic?

1648
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:41,180
What do you think it is, Mom? Wild guess. Dick. Pic.

1649
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:46,250
You know, honey, when I had... times like this,

1650
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,650
I had to search myself

1651
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:50,660
and remember...

1652
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,190
why I became a mother in the first place.

1653
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:58,000
And that was helpful.

1654
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:04,200
Is this that kid Jacob's house? Is that where we're going?

1655
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,250
Just calm down, okay? Please tell me where we are.

1656
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:07,970
I don't want to get arrested.

1657
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:10,210
Will you just trust me? Come on.

1658
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,080
Oh. Hi.

1659
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,150
Hey. I don't know if you guys remember us.

1660
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:23,320
Pete and Ellie from foster orientation?

1661
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,920
Oh, yeah. Hi. How you doing?

1662
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,550
Uh, what can we do for you?

1663
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,260
So now she wants to come back and be Mommy again.

1664
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,990
And it looks like she's got a real shot.

1665
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,430
Lizzy, she's treating us like we're the enemy.

1666
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:37,630
Now we don't know what the hell to do.

1667
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:39,870
So I just thought, I mean, your daughter turned out so great.

1668
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:43,030
Is she up there studying? Hey, Brenda, you gonna come down?

1669
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,060
I thought maybe we could speak with her,

1670
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,970
and she'd get us pumped up like before.

1671
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:50,440
Is that a possibility? Yeah, that'd be great. She was amazing.

1672
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,340
We could use a pep talk right now.

1673
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:56,950
Um, Brenda is, um... back in rehab.

1674
01:26:56,950 --> 01:27:00,150
Excuse me, what? We caught her using a couple months ago.

1675
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:02,280
Are you shitting me right now?

1676
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:04,890
Her inspirational, heartwarming goddamn speech

1677
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:08,220
is the reason we signed up for this shit-show in the first place!

1678
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:10,290
Now you're telling me she's back on... Ow!

1679
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:12,190
You listen to me, crazy woman!

1680
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,100
Brenda has struggled with substance abuse

1681
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,130
ever since her mother's boyfriend started her on meth when she was 11.

1682
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:19,730
Sometimes she stumbles. But she is a good kid.

1683
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:22,800
And she's in there doing the work, getting herself clean.

1684
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,900
So you don't know what's gonna happen.

1685
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:28,840
And this has you feeling what? Frustrated? Scared? Lost? Is that it?

1686
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:34,100
Yes! I'm a little afraid to say anything, but yes, that's basically

1687
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:34,780
how we feel.

1688
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:38,520
That's how your children feel every day of their lives.

1689
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,420
When you took this on, you felt good about yourself

1690
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:44,790
because you knew that it mattered, right?

1691
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:46,490
Well, guess what.

1692
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:49,930
Things that matter are hard.

1693
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:51,590
Now I know where Brenda

1694
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:53,900
gets her inspiring speech thing.

1695
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:56,600
Listen, guys, right now, you're all they've got.

1696
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,770
So your job is to keep them safe,

1697
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:00,870
whether they want you to or not.

1698
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,870
He's got it too.

1699
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,940
That was incredible. Thank you.

1700
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:10,800
I'm so sorry that I blew up at you.

1701
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,810
I'm sorry I slapped you!

1702
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:16,820
I know! That was crazy! I know. I apologize.

1703
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:20,020
It was good. I needed it. I haven't been slapped for a long time.

1704
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:22,760
It was a bit aggressive. It was a little bit out of line.

1705
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,490
Well, you were, honey. You were.

1706
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:26,560
All right, honey, we gotta go.

1707
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,830
We gotta get going. Take care.

1708
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:30,460
Thank you.

1709
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:33,160
You're on Facebook, right? I'll find you. Okay!

1710
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:35,770
Bye! Bye! Thank you!

1711
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:37,040
Bye.

1712
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,670
Let's get in the house right away, really quick.

1713
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:53,250
Okay, you're all set. Bye, Lizzy.

1714
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:55,520
Have a great day.

1715
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:58,690
All right, look, you drop them off.

1716
01:28:58,690 --> 01:29:01,260
I'm gonna find this Jacob kid and get to the bottom of this, okay?

1717
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,420
Okay. All right.

1718
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:04,260
Wait, Pete, that's him! What?

1719
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:07,530
Him? That redhead kid right there? The kid with the soup can for a...?

1720
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:09,560
Come on. I'm getting him.

1721
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:12,330
You! Dick pic! Hey! Hey!

1722
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:16,040
Hey! Excuse me. What's up, man? Wanted to catch a fade, huh?

1723
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,710
Dick pic! Think it's okay?

1724
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:20,010
Sending pictures of your knob to a 15-year-old girl?

1725
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:22,510
You're lucky I don't end your life right now, carrot top.

1726
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:24,840
I saw what you wrote to her: "If you don't show me something, I'm

1727
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:25,580
gonna lose interest."

1728
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:28,080
That's actually sexual assault, young man. It's disgusting!

1729
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,250
Not such a big man now, are you? Come on, whip it out!

1730
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:33,650
Show everybody those big shaved plums you're so proud of!

1731
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,070
We're gonna call your mom, tell the principal, maybe even call the

1732
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:36,320
police.

1733
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,220
What do you think of that, Jacob? My name's not Jacob!

1734
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:41,860
What? My name is Charlie.

1735
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:43,090
That's Charlie.

1736
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,460
I thought you said his name was Jacob. Really?

1737
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:47,300
And my plums aren't shaved.

1738
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:48,800
Or big.

1739
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,400
I'm so sorry. Oh, God. I'm so sorry, honey.

1740
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:56,340
Come on, buddy, suck it up. It's a little snafu, okay?

1741
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,170
Come on. Give me a hug, Charlie.

1742
01:29:58,180 --> 01:29:59,840
All right, look at me.

1743
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,880
Do you happen to know anybody named Jacob

1744
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,250
who might be hanging around with our daughter, Lizzy Viara?

1745
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:08,020
The janitor? The adult-ass janitor?

1746
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:09,980
Oh, my God. Come on, let's get the janitor.

1747
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:11,990
Hey, I'm so sorry about this. Ellie, come on!

1748
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,990
Thank you so much! He didn't do any of that.

1749
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:15,890
Come on, Ellie. He didn't do any of it!

1750
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:18,390
Hurry up! I'm so sorry, Charlie!

1751
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:21,400
I think we're gonna be late for school.

1752
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:30,740
Ellie

1753
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:34,310
He's on a Zamboni. Come on!

1754
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:47,490
Hey! Hey, you!

1755
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:49,020
Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

1756
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:51,060
How old are you, Jump Street? Why you want to know?

1757
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:52,920
Hey, lady, gimme that. That's not yours. He's 22!

1758
01:30:52,930 --> 01:30:55,520
He's 22. Yeah, I'm 22. So what?

1759
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:57,700
So this won't be child abuse. Pete!

1760
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:03,630
Hey, you ever touch, text, or think about our daughter ever again,

1761
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:05,230
and you're a dead man.

1762
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,270
I'm gonna sue you, man! You're not even her parents!

1763
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:09,870
Would not-her-parents do this?

1764
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:12,610
Miss Peppers!

1765
01:31:12,610 --> 01:31:14,370
Whoa. Whoa. What's happening here?

1766
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:17,580
This man has been sending lewd comments and photos to our daughter.

1767
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:20,510
You're going to jail today, Jacob! You mind calling the police?

1768
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:23,020
Absolutely! Miss Peppers!

1769
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:25,150
Mother...

1770
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:26,490
All right. We appreciate it.

1771
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,230
Man, I didn't even touch that girl.

1772
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:35,460
Bye-bye, scumbag. Filthy pedophile.

1773
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:38,300
Yeah. Enjoy your life as a sex offender.

1774
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,230
Pedophile.

1775
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,530
You're arresting us? The guy was sending pictures of his knob to a

1776
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:42,730
minor.

1777
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:46,270
Why are you arresting us? Really good. Good work, guys.

1778
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,680
For what it's worth, I heard what you guys did in there.

1779
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,350
You're good parents, looking out for your kids.

1780
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:00,780
If I'd had a chance to do the same...

1781
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:02,220
The kids! Oh, my God!

1782
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:06,690
Juan, Lita! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! Guys!

1783
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:14,500
Hey. Hey, baby.

1784
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:18,500
My God, it's so clean.

1785
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,730
Well, there are my little gangsters.

1786
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:23,970
Posting bail for my Petey.

1787
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:26,070
Really took me back to the good old days.

1788
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:28,240
Thank you, by the way. Where are the kids?

1789
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:31,040
Karen had to take them to a temporary placement for the night.

1790
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:33,210
She said it's the first time she's heard of CPS

1791
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,250
removing kids from their adoptive home the night before their hearing.

1792
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:42,250
Speaking of which, I found your statement to the judge on your printer.

1793
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,890
Needs some work.

1794
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:46,060
Mom, it's too late. We submitted it last week.

1795
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,560
Well, resubmit it! Jesus!

1796
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,130
"We want whatever is best for the kids,

1797
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:54,360
whether that means staying with us or returning to their birth mother. "

1798
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:57,600
What if the judge reads that crap in front of Lizzy?

1799
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,530
That's why we wrote it like that, Mom.

1800
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:02,040
If she thinks our statement's the reason her mom doesn't get custody,

1801
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,140
she's gonna hate us more than she does now.

1802
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:07,010
She doesn't hate you. She just thinks you don't love her.

1803
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:09,550
And that statement ain't gonna help.

1804
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:16,290
Did Lizzy tell you that? Oh, come on, Ellie.

1805
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:18,250
I grew up a lot like that kid.

1806
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:21,190
You get reminded what a sack of shit you are five times a day,

1807
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:25,660
after a while, you can't believe anyone could ever love you.

1808
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,800
You know that we love you, right?

1809
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,500
No.

1810
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,260
But that's not you, it's me.

1811
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:38,400
I thought I just covered all that.

1812
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:46,410
But I do love you both.

1813
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,850
Get some sleep, kids.

1814
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:52,820
After you fix that god-awful statement.

1815
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:54,150
Wow.

1816
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:01,960
It's so clean and quiet in here.

1817
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:04,630
I know.

1818
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,030
I hate it.

1819
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,530
Me too.

1820
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,240
Hey. Hey.

1821
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:23,380
Guys. We are so sorry.

1822
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:25,680
We are so sorry. Are you okay?

1823
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:28,750
Guess what? We got a ride in a police car.

1824
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:31,120
You did? Was that fun?

1825
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,790
Did you guys go to prison? No. We were... just in jail.

1826
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:37,450
Juan. Lita. Come on.

1827
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:38,930
Mom's here. Okay.

1828
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:55,240
Okay, folks, our .26 hearing is now a Change of Circumstance hearing

1829
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,770
for a Miss Carla Viara.

1830
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:00,480
And you are Miss Viara, yes? She is, Your Honor.

1831
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:04,350
And also with us today are Juan, Lita, and Elizabeth Viara?

1832
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:06,020
Here. Here!

1833
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:08,020
And did you two each get a teddy bear?

1834
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:11,690
Yes! Oh, those are good ones.

1835
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:14,290
And you are Elizabeth? It's Lizzy, sir.

1836
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:16,090
I mean, Your Honor.

1837
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:18,860
And, Lizzy, I understand that you've submitted a statement.

1838
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:24,660
And the foster parents, Mr. And Mrs. Wagner, are they present as well?

1839
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:26,370
Yes, Your Honor.

1840
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:28,340
And, Mr. And Mrs. Wagner,

1841
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:31,070
is it accurate that you left Juan and Lita alone in your car

1842
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:33,910
while you were being arrested for aggravated assault?

1843
01:35:33,910 --> 01:35:36,340
Well, that... Yes, Your Honor, but in our defense...

1844
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:39,380
Sir, all I need to know is whether or not Lizzy is lying.

1845
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:41,280
No, she's not lying.

1846
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,650
And prior to that assault,

1847
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:47,290
did you accost a 14-year-old honor student in the same school yard

1848
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:52,860
and encourage him "to whip out his big, shaved plums"?

1849
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:56,360
I said that, Your Honor, but again,

1850
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,830
I thought it was the person who sent her the...

1851
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:02,710
Mrs. Wagner, did you at one time force Lizzy's friends to leave your

1852
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:02,930
home

1853
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:04,400
by way of a bedroom window?

1854
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,770
It was a ground floor window. Good. Points for you.

1855
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:12,020
And at that same occasion, did you tell Lizzy to call CPS and to come

1856
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:13,110
and take the kids?

1857
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:15,440
She didn't mean that. I did not mean that.

1858
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:17,140
That was in the heat of an argument.

1859
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:20,250
Your Honor, I have a statement. Yes, I've read it, thank you.

1860
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:23,680
We actually wrote a new one. Ma'am, excuse me, but I have your...

1861
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:26,740
Please, Your Honor, we were up late working on it. I can read it very

1862
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:26,950
fast.

1863
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,060
"Lizzy once asked us why we took them in.

1864
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:32,260
And at the time, we couldn't answer her."

1865
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:36,470
Ma'am, please sit down. Please, Your Honor, can you let me say

1866
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:37,160
the answer?

1867
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:38,800
No. Sit.

1868
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,730
This hearing is not about you.

1869
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:44,170
Judging by Lizzy's statement, you might be back in court soon enough,

1870
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:47,170
so let's save that heartwarming speech for that occasion.

1871
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:51,470
Okay. Now, Miss Viara,

1872
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:55,150
I see that you've been keeping up with your visits. That's good.

1873
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:58,280
I also understand that you've been sober for the last five months.

1874
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,720
Is that still the case?

1875
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:04,220
Yes. That's very good news.

1876
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:08,260
And if I were to put the kids in your care,

1877
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:11,300
your current residence could accommodate them?

1878
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,230
I think so.

1879
01:37:14,230 --> 01:37:18,130
It's small, but it works... Your Honor.

1880
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:23,040
And, Miss Viara, do you feel capable of responsibly caring

1881
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,640
for Juan, Lita, and Lizzy at this time?

1882
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:34,250
Miss Viara.

1883
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:38,680
Mama.

1884
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:44,190
Yes, Your Honor. I'm capable now.

1885
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:12,010
Everybody get ready for dinner.

1886
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:22,860
Here you go.

1887
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:25,530
What if when we go live with our mom,

1888
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:28,730
she doesn't know how to make my noodles the way I like to have them?

1889
01:38:28,730 --> 01:38:31,660
Don't worry, pal. Lizzy will show her the way we do the cheese for you

1890
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,930
so your mom can make it for you just the way you like.

1891
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:36,830
Yeah. Okay.

1892
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:41,240
Come on, guys. Don't be sad on our last night.

1893
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:45,940
You know what? I think we should tell Pete and Ellie thank you,

1894
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:48,450
you know, for everything they've done for us, yeah?

1895
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:51,710
Thank you. Well, thank you, pal.

1896
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,320
Yeah, thank you, guys.

1897
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:56,390
Lita? I don't want to say anything.

1898
01:38:56,390 --> 01:38:58,020
Oh, honey.

1899
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:06,690
I'm just gonna go check on Lita.

1900
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:10,570
I mean, unless you want to.

1901
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:13,970
Yeah, I would, actually. Thanks.

1902
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:19,970
Come on, buddy. You haven't touched your pasta.

1903
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:22,380
You want me to reheat it for you?

1904
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,510
It's okay, buddy.

1905
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,390
That's okay, buddy.

1906
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:43,860
Good night, buddy. Good night.

1907
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:48,730
Sweetie, good night. I love you.

1908
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:50,470
Love you too.

1909
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:53,260
Okay, all your court bears are in here, the new ones as well.

1910
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,430
Speaking of court, um,

1911
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,730
I just wanted to apologize for what I wrote to the judge.

1912
01:41:02,730 --> 01:41:05,100
It was all true.

1913
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,800
It was a little out of context maybe, but there's no hard feelings.

1914
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:10,240
Actually, I wanted to give you the statement we wrote

1915
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:13,470
that we couldn't read in court, just so you have it.

1916
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:15,710
Yeah.

1917
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:18,850
Guys, Mom's here.

1918
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:22,080
All right. Get up! Come on. Let's go.

1919
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,720
Lita, come on, get your stuff.

1920
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,220
Bye, Meatball.

1921
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:34,030
Hey. I've got a car seat for Lita if you don't have one.

1922
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:40,800
You guys picking us up? Where's Mom?

1923
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,600
She was supposed to meet us at the office this morning

1924
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,830
and she didn't show.

1925
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,340
Oh, no.

1926
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:48,200
She didn't answer her phone.

1927
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:51,240
Did you go to her house? What if something happened to her?

1928
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,010
Yes, we went to see her. She was very ashamed.

1929
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:56,310
She said... she can't do it.

1930
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:00,520
No, she didn't. Because why would she, um, fill out all the forms

1931
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:03,120
and the court stuff and reunification stuff if she didn't...

1932
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:06,820
Lizzy, your mom said you filled out all those forms. I helped,

1933
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:07,490
but so what?

1934
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:11,300
She felt she was being pushed into something that she wasn't ready

1935
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:11,530
for.

1936
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:14,700
No. I didn't push her. She's ready!

1937
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:16,800
Just let me talk to her, please,

1938
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,300
and then we can figure something out.

1939
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:21,400
Honey. And she can take me home.

1940
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:25,010
Honey, when we saw her, it was obvious.

1941
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:27,010
She's using again.

1942
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,840
She's not coming, baby.

1943
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:33,610
Sweetie, we're so sorry.

1944
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,250
Lizzy
Lizzy.

1945
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:41,190
I'll go get her. You watch the kids.

1946
01:42:41,190 --> 01:42:44,320
Just wait there, okay? Lizzy!

1947
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,260
Lizzy
Lizzy!

1948
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:00,900
Lizzy  Lizzy
Lizzy? Lizzy!

1949
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:10,380
Lizzy. Please just go away. You're not my parents.

1950
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:12,680
No, we're not. But you know what we are? We're here.

1951
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:15,080
That's right, we're here and we love you.

1952
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:18,550
What? No, you don't. You don't even know me.

1953
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:21,050
Hey, what the hell's going on out here?

1954
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:24,020
Could you just give us a few minutes, please?

1955
01:43:24,730 --> 01:43:27,030
Oh, okay. Sorry.

1956
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:31,030
Lizzy, honey, we do know you.

1957
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:34,400
We... We know that you hate cheese,

1958
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,800
but you really love cheeseburgers.

1959
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,570
And we know that when you feel good in the morning,

1960
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:42,670
you put on a little less makeup than you do on the bad days.

1961
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:45,410
Exactly. And we know that the most important thing in the world to you

1962
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:48,440
is to protect Juan and Lita from the things nobody protected you from.

1963
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:50,480
We know that about you, right? Yes, honey.

1964
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,450
You guys are doing good.

1965
01:43:52,450 --> 01:43:55,080
I'm sorry. We know there's so much we don't know.

1966
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:58,960
But if you're afraid we can't handle knowing the bad stuff, or the

1967
01:43:58,960 --> 01:43:59,660
scary stuff,

1968
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:01,190
we can, I promise.

1969
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:03,730
Yeah, bring it. Whatever you got, we want it.

1970
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:05,730
Because we love you, Lizzy.

1971
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:10,000
Stop saying that. Please just go away, please.

1972
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:13,600
Please.

1973
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:37,350
Is Lizzy okay? She's a little upset right now, buddy.

1974
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:38,960
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good.

1975
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,230
Here she is.

1976
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:48,430
So...

1977
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:52,700
um, here's what I think is best.

1978
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:57,250
I know Juan and Lita are more like what you had in mind when you got

1979
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:57,910
into this.

1980
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:59,610
Come on, baby.

1981
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:03,440
So I think the best thing is for you to adopt them.

1982
01:45:03,450 --> 01:45:09,180
And... And I'll just ask Karen for, um, a different placement.

1983
01:45:09,190 --> 01:45:10,350
So... No.

1984
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:12,090
No, it'll be good. No, honey.

1985
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:13,620
We need your help with Juan and Lita.

1986
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:15,790
We're not doing this without you.

1987
01:45:15,790 --> 01:45:18,660
I'll visit all the time and you can call me if you need help for

1988
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:19,060
anything.

1989
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:22,660
No. Pete, I really don't want to argue about this right now.

1990
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:26,300
I don't care. I said no. That's not happening, okay?

1991
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:27,830
You're with us now. Yeah.

1992
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,900
And you know why? We've got a cosmic connection.

1993
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:32,000
That's right, we've got a cosmic connection.

1994
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:34,870
I know you feel sorry for me right now, but you really don't have to..

1995
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:36,880
It's got nothing to do with what just happened.

1996
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,710
Where's the court statement Ellie gave you?

1997
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:47,090
See this? Read that.

1998
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:54,490
"Lizzy once asked me why we did this, why we took them in.

1999
01:45:54,490 --> 01:45:57,530
We couldn't give her an answer at the time.

2000
01:45:57,530 --> 01:46:01,670
We did it because something was missing in our lives, but we didn't

2001
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:02,700
know what it was.

2002
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:07,670
It was Juan, Lita, and Lizzy."

2003
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:09,040
You see?

2004
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,810
You were what was missing, Lizzy.

2005
01:46:11,810 --> 01:46:14,980
But now you're here and you are stuck with us.

2006
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:17,540
That's right. We're gonna be at every soccer game.

2007
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:19,980
We're gonna be all over your ass about your grades.

2008
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:21,980
We're gonna buy you your first prom dress.

2009
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:26,290
It's gonna be really pretty. But not too revealing. Super sweet.

2010
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:28,220
You know, not too sexy.

2011
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:31,120
Just like... really, that gorgeous sweet spot.

2012
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:32,690
Yeah. And when you graduate high school,

2013
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:35,130
we're gonna be in the front row embarrassing you.

2014
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:37,610
We're gonna be in the front row again when you graduate college, or

2015
01:46:37,610 --> 01:46:38,260
even if you don't.

2016
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:40,860
You will be graduating college, 'cause it's so important and you're

2017
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:41,200
so smart.

2018
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:44,900
I don't mean to push, but it just opens up so many more opportunities.

2019
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:47,540
But either way, we're gonna be there for you.

2020
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:49,670
And someday I'm gonna give you away at your wedding.

2021
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:52,910
Even if I think the guy's a pissant and he's not good enough for my

2022
01:46:52,910 --> 01:46:53,480
little girl.

2023
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:55,210
That's right. Someday in the future.

2024
01:46:55,210 --> 01:47:00,150
Someday in the way, way, way off, deep, deep, deep distant future.

2025
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:03,350
Lizzy, can we go home now?

2026
01:47:08,230 --> 01:47:09,730
Yeah, I guess we can.

2027
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,730
I know you don't like this,

2028
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:20,130
but you're gonna have to get used to it once in a while, okay?

2029
01:47:20,130 --> 01:47:23,780
Can I get one? I haven't gotten a single hug from you since I've

2030
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:24,340
known you.

2031
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:26,370
Please?

2032
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:34,880
Hi. I don't know the whole context of everything.

2033
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:39,090
But I'm just wondering if I can just get in on that hug a little bit.

2034
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:41,850
We're good! Thank you so much. We're good, thank you.

2035
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:46,060
Sorry. That was just wrong. Yeah, I just do that. You guys hug.

2036
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:47,820
I crossed a boundary there.

2037
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:50,100
Everything's gonna work out great too.

2038
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:52,600
I can tell.

2039
01:47:54,830 --> 01:47:56,070
Hi!

2040
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:59,670
Oh! Oh, thank you!

2041
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:02,910
Bye. Bye!

2042
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:10,910
Are you with them? Do you know those guys?

2043
01:48:10,910 --> 01:48:13,010
Yeah. Why?

2044
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:14,480
Do you guys want to come in?

2045
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:17,050
Uh... I-I made a pie.

2046
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:18,520
No, thank you. Yes!

2047
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:20,720
Karen! It's pie. You know I love pie.

2048
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:25,530
Great. Yeah, I just... I have so many feelings.

2049
01:49:02,060 --> 01:49:04,960
Go potty, put your shoes on. We're gonna go, okay?

2050
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:06,430
Okay!

2051
01:49:06,430 --> 01:49:07,930
Whoa, Juan. What are you doing, buddy?

2052
01:49:07,930 --> 01:49:09,560
You can't wear sneakers. We gotta look good today.

2053
01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:12,030
Mom, have you seen my phone?

2054
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:16,040
Uh, no. Wait, you mean the one in your hand?

2055
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:18,270
Lita, honey, did you go potty?

2056
01:49:18,270 --> 01:49:19,870
I went potty! Okay, good job.

2057
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:21,870
Everybody go potty! Yeah, I went potty.

2058
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:24,380
Got that packet we're supposed to bring? Yeah, I'm all set.

2059
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:26,780
Let's go, guys. Let's go.

2060
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:32,420
I'm gonna beat you!

2061
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:36,760
No, no, no.

2062
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:40,290
No distracted driving, okay?

2063
01:49:40,290 --> 01:49:41,830
All right. All right?

2064
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:43,660
She's gonna drive. Oh, yeah?

2065
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:46,030
Yes, but I have the phone and I'll sit in the front

2066
01:49:46,030 --> 01:49:49,940
in case I have to grab the wheel or shut down the power, okay?

2067
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:56,870
Sandy, come on, it's started!

2068
01:49:57,610 --> 01:49:59,410
Did I make it? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2069
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:02,080
What's that?

2070
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,610
Lizzy made it for me. You didn't get one?

2071
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:08,420
You got a T-shirt? You got a T-shirt?

2072
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:10,650
You may all be seated.

2073
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:14,120
Good morning, folks.

2074
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:15,860
You know, family court is important...

2075
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:19,760
Wait. Wait! Wait! Wait.

2076
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:23,600
Grandma Sandy's in the house. We can begin.

2077
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:26,200
Told you we'd make it. Stop it!

2078
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:28,430
These seats are saved. Yeah, they're saved for me.

2079
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:31,010
Move over. Stop it!

2080
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:35,270
Go ahead, Judge. Thank you, Grandma Sandy.

2081
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:37,910
She got a T-shirt.

2082
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:41,410
You know, family court is important work.

2083
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:43,150
But it's difficult work.

2084
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:46,320
We spend day in and day out dealing with things

2085
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:49,490
that we feel no family should have to go through.

2086
01:50:49,490 --> 01:50:52,990
So on these rare days when we get to smile at work,

2087
01:50:54,030 --> 01:50:56,190
these days mean a great deal to all of us.

2088
01:50:56,200 --> 01:51:00,360
And I may not look it, but I'm a huge cornball

2089
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,800
and I live for this.

2090
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,470
Ronit
Ronit?

2091
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:11,270
Yeah!

2092
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:12,870
I love this song.

2093
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:16,780
We are here today to officially create a new family.

2094
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:18,880
Peter and Elinore Wagner,

2095
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:23,950
do you wish to adopt Juan, Lita, and Lizzy into your family today?

2096
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:26,390
Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your Honor.

2097
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:30,360
It's just the song that's got me a little emotional.

2098
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:33,060
Juan, Lita, and Lizzy,

2099
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:36,430
would you like Peter and Elinore to be your mom and dad?

2100
01:51:36,430 --> 01:51:38,000
Sure.

2101
01:51:38,670 --> 01:51:41,070
Yes, please. Yes!

2102
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:43,330
Well, then,

2103
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:46,400
by the authority vested in me by the state of California,

2104
01:51:46,410 --> 01:51:49,710
I pronounce you a family.

2105
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:08,560
Here you go. Thank you.

2106
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,780
Would you like to take a picture with the judge? Yeah, sure.

2107
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:11,130
Thank you.

2108
01:52:11,130 --> 01:52:13,230
Yeah, let's do it.

2109
01:52:13,230 --> 01:52:15,700
That's gonna be us soon.

2110
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:19,200
Oh, I'm part of this family too.

2111
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:22,140
Okay, thank you. Wait, me too!

2112
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:25,510
I'd like to be in the picture. Are you sure? We're not...

2113
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:28,180
We should all go. I think they'd like that.

2114
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:29,940
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

2115
01:52:40,050 --> 01:52:42,420
Okay! Okay.

2116
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:44,060
Anybody else?

2117
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:47,130
Yeah, you too. Come on!

2118
01:52:48,830 --> 01:52:51,230
Okay, I think that's everybody.

2119
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:54,600
Say "Family." Family!



2120
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
